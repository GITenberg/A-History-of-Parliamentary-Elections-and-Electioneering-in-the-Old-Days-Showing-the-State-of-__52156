<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noindent">Apart from political parties, we are all concerned in that
important national birthright, the due representation of
the people. It will be conceded that the most important
element of Parliaments&mdash;specially chosen to embody the
collective wisdom of the nation&mdash;is the legitimate method of
their constitution. Given the unrestricted rights of election,
a representative House of Commons is the happy result;
the opposite follows a tampering with the franchise, and
debauched constituencies. The effects of bribery, intimidation,
undue influence, coercion on the part of the Crown
or its responsible advisers, an extensive system of personal
patronage, boroughmongering, close or pocket boroughs,
and all those contraband devices of old to hamper the
popular choice of representatives, have inevitably produced
a legislature more or less corrupt, as history has registered.
Bad as were the workings of the electoral system anterior
to the advent of parliamentary reform, it speaks volumes
for the manly nature of British electors and their representatives
that Parliaments thus basely constituted were, on
the whole, fairly honest, nor unmindful altogether of those
liberties of the subject they were by supposition elected
to maintain; and when symptoms of corruption in the
Commons became patent, the degeneracy was not long
countenanced, the national spirit being sufficiently vigorous
to crush the threatened evils, and bring about a healthier
state of things.</p>

<p>The comprehensive subject of parliamentary elections is
rich in interest and entertainment; the history of the rise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
progress, and development of the complex art of electioneering
recommends itself to the attention of all who
have an interest in the features inseparable from that
constitution which has been lauded as a model for other
nations to imitate. The strong national characteristics
surrounding, in bygone days, the various stages of parliamentary
election&mdash;peculiarly a British institution, in which,
of all people, our countrymen were most at home&mdash;are
now, by an improved elective procedure, relegated to the
limbo of the past, while the records of electioneering exist
but as traditions in the present.</p>

<p>With the modifying influence of progress, and a more
advanced civilisation, the time may come when the narrative
of the robustious scenes of canvassing, polling, chairing,
and election-feasting, with their attendant incidents of all-prevailing
bribery, turbulence, and intrigue, may be
regarded with incredulity as fictions of an impossible age.</p>

<p>It has been endeavoured to give the salient features of
the most remarkable election contests, from the time when
seats began to be sought after until comparatively recent
days. The “Spendthrift Elections,” remarkable in the
annals of parliamentary and party warfare, are set down,
with a selection from the literature, squibs, ballads, and
broadsides to which they gave rise. The illustrations are
selected from the pictorial satires produced contemporaneously
upon the most famous electoral struggles. The
materials, both literary and graphic, are abundant, but
scattered; it is hoped that both entertainment and enlightenment
may be afforded to a tolerant public by the
writer’s efforts to bring these resources within the compass
of a volume.

<p class="ph1">A HISTORY OF

PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS

IN THE OLD DAYS.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="medium">CONCERNING EARLY PARLIAMENTS AND ELECTIONS OF KNIGHTS
AND BURGESSES.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The subject of elections being so indissolubly bound up
with that of parliamentary assemblages and dissolutions, it
will not be out of place to glance at the progress of that
institution. John was the first king recorded to summon
his barons by writ; this was directed to the Bishop of
Salisbury. In 1234 a representative parliament of two
knights from every shire was convened to grant an aid;
later on (1286) came the parliament of Merton; and in
1258 was inaugurated the assembly of knights and burgesses,
designated the <i>mad</i> parliament. The first assembly
of the Commons as “a confirmed representation” (Dugdale)
was in 1265, when the earliest writ extant was
issued; while, according to many historians, the first
regular parliament met in 1294 (22 Edw. 1), when borough
representation is said to have commenced. From a deliberative
assembly, it became in 1308 a legislative power,
without whose assent no law could be legally constituted;
and in 1311, annual parliaments were ordered. The next
progressive step was the election of a Speaker by the
Commons; the first was Peter de la Mare, 1377. A parliament
of <i>one</i> day (September 29, 1399), when Richard II.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
was deposed, is certainly an incident in the history of this
institution; the Commons now began to assert its control
over pecuniary grants. In 1404 was held at Coventry the
“Parliamentum Indoctum” from which lawyers were
excluded (and that must have offered a marked contrast to
parliaments in our generation). In 1407 the Lords and
Commons assembled to transact business in the Sovereign’s
absence. Reforms were clearly then deemed expedient:
in 1413 members were obliged to reside at the places they
represented,&mdash;this enactment has occasioned expense and
inconvenience in obeying “the letter,” but appears to have
otherwise been easily defeated as regards “the spirit;”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
in 1430 the Commons adopted the forty-shillings qualification
for county members. A parliament was held at
Coventry in 1459; this was called the <i>Diabolicum</i>. The
statutes were first printed in 1483; in 1542 the privilege
of exemption from arrest was secured to members; and in
1549 the eldest sons of Peers were admitted to sit in the
Commons. With James I. commenced those collisions
between the Crown and the representatives of the people
which marked the Stuart rule. The Commons resisted
those fine old blackmail robberies known during preceding
reigns as “benevolences,” under which plea forced contributions
were levied by the Crown, especially during Elizabeth’s
reign. James I. pushed these abuses too far, in his
greed for money.</p>

<p>The parliament of 1614 refused to grant supplies until
grievances were redressed; James dismissed them, and
imprisoned several members. This short session was
known as the “Addled Parliament.” The “Long Parliament”
assembled in 1640, and the House of Peers was
abolished by it in 1649; and later on, a Peer sat in the
Commons. This parliament, proving intractable, was dissolved
by Cromwell in 1653. Under Charles II., with the
restoration of monarchy, the Peers temporal resumed their
functions, and in 1661 the Lords spiritual were allowed to

resume their seats, and the Act for triennial parliaments
was unwisely set aside by the Commons. The relations
between the Crown and the Commons were again becoming
strained in 1667, when an Act excluding Roman Catholics
from sitting in either House was forced through the legislature.
From this point the narrative of electioneering
incidents may commence, the more appropriately since it
was at this time there arose the institution of the familiar
party distinctions of Whig and Tory.</p>

<p>The orders for the attendance of members and the
Speaker were somewhat curious; for instance, among the
orders in parliament regulating procedure, the following
are noteworthy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Feb. 14, 1606.&mdash;The House to assemble at eight o’clock, and enter
into the great business at nine.</p>

<p>May 13, 1614.&mdash;The House to meet at seven o’clock in the morning,
and begin to read bills at ten.</p>

<p>Feb. 15, 1620.&mdash;The Speaker not to move his hat until the third
<i>cong&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>Nov. 12, 1640.&mdash;Those who go out of the House in a confused manner
before the Speaker to forfeit 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>May 1, 1641.&mdash;All the members that come after eight to pay 1<i>s.</i>,
and those that do not come the whole day to pay 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>April 19, 1642.&mdash;Those who do not come to prayers to pay 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Feb. 14, 1643.&mdash;Such members as come after nine o’clock to pay 1<i>s.</i>
to the poor.</p>

<p>March 21, 1647.&mdash;The Speaker to leave the chair at twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>May 31, 1659.&mdash;The Speaker to take the chair constantly every
morning by eight o’clock.</p>

<p>April 8, 1670.&mdash;The back door in the Speaker’s chamber to be
nailed up during the session.</p>

<p>March 23, 1693.&mdash;No member to take tobacco into the gallery, or
to the table, sitting at committees.</p>

<p>Feb. 11, 1695.&mdash;No news-letter writer to presume to meddle with
the debates, or disperse any in their papers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Orders touching motions for leave into the country:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Feb. 13, 1620.&mdash;No member shall go out of town without open
motion and licence in the House.</p>

<p>March 28, 1664.&mdash;The penalty of &pound;10 to be paid by every knight,
and &pound;5 by every citizen, etc., who shall make default in attending.</p>

<p>Nov. 6, 1666.&mdash;To be sent for in custody of the serjeant.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>Dec. 18, 1666.&mdash;Such members of the House as depart into the
country without leave, be sent for in custody of the serjeant-at-arms.</p>

<p>Feb. 13, 1667.&mdash;That every defaulter in attendance, whose excuse
shall not be allowed this day, be fined the sum of &pound;40, and sent for in
custody, and committed to the Tower till the fine be paid.</p>

<p>That every member as shall desert the service of the House for the
space of three days together (not having had leave granted him by the
House, nor offering such sufficient excuse to the House as shall be
allowed), shall have the like fine of &pound;40 imposed on them, and shall be
sent for in custody, and committed to the Tower; and that the fines
be paid into the hands of the serjeant-at-arms, to be disposed of as the
House shall direct.</p>

<p>April 6, 1668.&mdash;To pay a fine of &pound;10.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few words of explanation regarding technicalities will
be found in place, since the qualifications of voters have a
distinctive language of their own, used to indicate their
various degrees of electoral privilege. The terms, “burgage
tenures,” “scot and lot,” “pot-wallopers,” “splitting,”
“faggot votes,” etc., occur constantly, and it may
be desirable to indicate in advance the meanings attached
to these enigmatical expressions.</p>

<p>Burgage tenures consist of one undivided and indivisible
tenement, neither created, nor capable of creation, within
time of memory, which has immemorially given a right of
voting; or an entire indivisible tenement, holden of the
superior lord of a borough, by an immemorial certain rent,
distinctly reserved, and to which the right of voting is
incident.</p>

<p>Another qualification determined the right of voting
“to be in such persons as are seized in fee, in possession,
or reversion, of any messuage, tenement, or corporal hereditament
within the borough, and in such persons as are
tenants for life or lives, and, for want of such freeholds, in
tenants for years determinable upon any life or lives,
paying scot and lot, and in them and in no other.”</p>

<p>Potwallers&mdash;those who, as lodgers, boil the pot. Pot-wallopers,
or Pot-boilers.</p>

<p>The word Burgess extends to inhabitants within the
borough.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>The right of election being generally vested “in inhabitants
paying scot and lot, and not receiving alms or any
charity,” these terms require explanation. What it is to
pay scot and lot, or to <i>pay scot</i> and <i>bear lot</i> is nowhere
exactly defined. According to Stockdale’s “Parliamentary
Guide,” compiled in 1784, it is probable that, from signifying
some special municipal or parochial tax or duty, they
came in time to be used in a popular sense, to comprehend
generally the burdens and obligations to which the inhabitants
of a borough or parish were liable as such. What
seems the proper interpretation is, that by inhabitants
“paying scot and lot,” those persons are meant whose circumstances
are sufficiently independent to enable them to
contribute in general to such taxes and burdens as they are
liable to as inhabitants of the place. In Scotland, when a
person petitions to be admitted a burgess of a royal
borough, he engages he will <i>scot</i> and <i>lot</i>, i.e. <i>watch</i> and
<i>ward</i>; and by statute (2 Geo. 1, c. 18, s. 9) it is ascertained
that in the election of representatives for the city of
London, the legislature understood <i>scot</i> and <i>lot</i> to be as here
explained.</p>

<p>As to the disqualifications, <i>alms</i> means parochial collections
or parish relief; and <i>charity</i> signifies sums arising
from the revenue of certain specific sums which have been
established or bequeathed for the purpose of assisting the
poor. There are further nice distinctions in the latter;
for on election petitions persons receiving certain defined
charities were qualified to vote, while other charities disqualify
for the identical return. The burgage tenement
decision which defines the nature of this qualification as
set down, arose on a controverted election in 1775 for
Downeton or Downton, a borough in Wilts, the right of
voting being admitted by both sides to be “in persons
having a freehold interest in burgage tenements, holden by
a certain rent, fealty, and suit of court, of the Bishop of
Winchester, who is lord of the borough, and paying reliefs
on descent and fines on alienation.” Thomas Duncombe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and Thomas Drummer were the sitting members; and the
counsel for the petitioners, Sir Philip Hales and John
Cooper, objected to some twenty votes recorded for the
candidates elected. “It was proved that the conveyances
to some were made in 1768, <i>i.e.</i> the last general election,
but that the deeds had remained since that time in the
hands of Mr. Duncombe, who is proprietor of nearly two-thirds
of the burgage tenements in Downton; so that
the occupiers had continued to pay their rents to him,
and expected to do so when they became due again, considering
him as their landlord, and being unacquainted
with the grants made by him to the voters; and that
there were no entries on the court rolls of 1768 of those
conveyances, nor of the payment of the alienation fines.
The conveyances to others appeared to have been
<i>printed</i> at the expense of Mr. Duncombe, and executed after
the writ and precept had been issued, some of them being
brought <i>wet</i> to the poll. The grantees did not know where
the lands contained in them lay, and one man at the poll
produced a grant for which he claimed a vote, which, on
examination, appeared to be made to another person.”
The practice of making such conveyances about the time
of an election had long prevailed in the borough; the votes
so manufactured were known by the name of <i>faggots</i>; and
the petitioners contended such votes, although pertaining
to obsolete “burgage” immunities, were “colourable,
fraudulent, and void,” both by the common law of parliament,
and the statute of William III. aimed at abuses, and
commonly called the <i>Splitting</i> Act. Besides the general
objection of “occasionally,” a proportion of the votes
for the sitting members was impeached for reasons drawn
from the nature of burgage tenements, as set forth in the
definition of these terms. Whence it was decided that
Mr. Duncombe had done his spiriting so clumsily that
neither he nor his colleague could be considered duly
elected as burgesses to serve in the parliament in question,
and the petitioners ought to be returned in their places.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>In 1826 the Earl of Radnor was patron of this same
borough of Downton, Sir T. B. Pechall and the Hon.
Bouverie being its representatives, and the votes being
vested in the persons having a freehold interest in burgage
tenures and held of the Bishop of Winchester; the number
of voters is not given&mdash;possibly J. J. Stockdale (election
agent), who compiled the “Election Manual,” was unable
to discover any.</p>

<p>It seems that, while they were permitted to exist,
those qualifications which surrounded burgage tenures were
founded on shadowy premises; for instance, Horsham
(Sussex) was summoned to send burgesses to parliament
from the 28th of Edward I. According to Bohun,
the Duke of Norfolk, as lord thereof, held the entire
election in his own hands, the bailiffs, chosen by the duke’s
steward in the court-leet held at Michaelmas, having been
the principal officers which returned members to serve in
parliament; while as to the constituents and their suffrages,
the qualifications for these add a fresh and startling
paragraph to the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The house or land that pays twelve pence a year to the Duke,
is called a whole burgership; but these tenancies have been splitted
into such small parts, that he who has only so much land, or part of
a house, as pays two pence a year, is now by custom entitled to vote
for members to serve in parliament; but it is the tenant of the freehold,
though not resident in the place, or occupier of the house, or
land, that has the right to vote.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The outlines of an election, when the state of “villainage,”
approximating to feudal serfdom, was the condition
of the labouring classes, have been sketched by Sir Francis
Palgrave. From the pages of his “Truths and Fictions of
the Middle Ages” we obtain a vivid picture of the manner
of the quest for representatives to serve the king in parliament,
as it might have presented itself to the faithful
lieges in the fourteenth century, at the three annual
seasons for summoning the chamber.</p>

<p>The sheriff, Sir Roger de Swigville, mounted on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
noble steed worthy of so stout a knight, rides up to
the county court, the scene of the elections of the period,
where is gathered a goodly assemblage of mounted gentry;
the sheriff’s javelin-men about him, his silken and
broidered banner waving in the breeze; and forthwith
is displayed the sacred scrap of parchment, the
“king’s writ,” informing the estates of the realm in the
learned Latin tongue, that a parliament is to be holden
at Westminster, Winchester, York, or elsewhere. The
baronage and freeholders are bidden to choose a worthy
and discreet knight of the shire for the county, to aid
the king with his advice,&mdash;duly providing for his expenses
during the term while parliament may sit, and for his
charges going and returning; but first taking due care
to ascertain if the great baron of the county&mdash;De Clare
or De Bohun&mdash;has not already signified, through his
steward or attorney, whom he would have chosen. The
name of Sir Fulke de Braose is mentioned&mdash;yonder handsome
“chivaler” who, hawk on wrist, is watching the
proceedings; but that gay knight preferreth the excitements
of war or sport, and at the Words “election” and
“parliament,” he hastily withdraws from the crowd, and
spurreth off as fast as his good horse may carry him.
The “Chiltern Hundreds” was a sanctuary where knights,
anxious to avoid the honour of being sent to the senate,
frequently sought refuge.</p>

<p>It was Elizabeth who took a practical course with her
faithful Commons, and in businesslike fashion admonished
them not to waste their time in long and vain discourses,
but to apply themselves at once to their function&mdash;that
of voting supplies, and, on occasions, of granting “benevolences,”
that is, forced loans to the Crown.</p>

<p>According to some writers, the earliest recorded instance
of corruption in electioneering matters occurred under date
1571, but the incident hardly comes under the description
of bribery. In the “Parliamentary History” (i. 765), it is
stated from the journals of 1571, that one Thomas Long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
was returned for the borough of Westbury, Wilts, who,
“being found to be a very simple man, and not fit to
serve in that place, was questioned how he came to be
elected.” It seems that extreme simplicity was so unusual
in the House that its presence was easily detected; in any
case, Thomas Long acted up to his reputation, and replied
with a frankness not commonly exhibited in the admissions
made before election committees and their perquisitions:
“The poor man immediately confessed to the House
that he gave to Anthony Garland, mayor of the said town
of Westbury, and one Watts of the same, &pound;4 for his place
in parliament.” This was certainly a modest consideration
for a seat, when it is considered that famous electioneering
tacticians, like the Duke of Wharton, in a later generation,
exhausted ample fortunes in the traffic of constituencies.
Moreover, this simple purchaser of a place in parliament,
though he forfeited his bargain, did not lose his money;
“an order was made that the said Garland and Watts
should repay unto the said Thos. Long the &pound;4 they had
of him.” Although the actual briber escaped scot-free,
the inquiry terminated with the infliction of a severe
penalty on those who had been convicted of venality, “a
fine of &pound;20 being assessed for the queen’s use on the said
corporation and inhabitants of Westbury for their scandalous
attempt.” This precept was not without its use, and
in the future history of this species of corruption it will be
found that mayors and corporations&mdash;in whose influence
once rested that “merchantable property,” the right
of selecting representatives&mdash;grew more experienced in
iniquitous ways, and exacted the highest tariff for the
saleable commodity they offered, besides making choice of
more cunning purchasers, and, moreover, generally managed
to get not only the best of the bargain, but contrived to
avoid being forced to disgorge their ill-gotten gains; the
proverb still remains, a relic of the days in which it had
its origin, “Money makes the mayor to go.”</p>

<p>The privilege of parliament which protected the persons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of members was already sought after in Elizabeth’s days
for its incidental advantages; thus, John Smith, whose
name is mentioned in the “Parliamentary History,” presented
himself to be elected for Camelford, for the purpose
of defrauding his creditors&mdash;a <i>ruse</i> which was allowed to
succeed by a tolerant chamber,&mdash;privilege, however, and
the continuance of his seat were voted by 112 to 107.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton, in 1571, speaks of “the imperfection of
choice, too often seen, by sending of unfit men;” and he
notices as one cause, “the choice made by boroughs, for
the most part of strangers.”</p>

<p>Interference in elections by the territorial lords, or by
the Church, was resented about this time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A penalty of &pound;40 proposed upon every borough that should elect
at the nomination of a nobleman, one great disorder, that many young
men, not experienced, for learning sake were often chosen. Proposed
that none under thirty years of age should be returned.”</p></blockquote>

<p>From the “Parliamentary History” we secure the
account of a disputed return for Buckinghamshire in the
year 1603, set down by the sheriff as returning officer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“About eight o’clock he came to Brickhill; was there told by Sir
George Throckmorton and others that the first voice would be given
for Sir Francis Goodwin; he answered ‘he hoped it would not be so,’
and ‘desired every gentleman to deal with his freeholders.’ After
eight went to the election.... After the writ was read, he first
intimated the points of the proclamation, then jointly proposed Sir
John Fortescue and Sir F. Goodwin. The freeholders cried, first,
‘A Goodwin, a Goodwin!’ Every Justice of the Peace on the bench
said, ‘A Fortescue, a Fortescue!’”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Election proceedings began early in those days, and
parliamentary hours were equally matinal. From the
pamphlets, tracts, and broadsides of the Stuart era it may
be noted that the Speaker took his place in the House at
eight o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>“The knights girt with swords by their sides,” as
returned for the shires of the counties, were important
personages, the influential families retaining this prerogative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
in their houses for generations; the names of the
great county families may be traced, according to their
respective localities, for more than a century in uninterrupted
succession as the county members, as may be
observed in the compendious lists of the knights, citizens,
and burgesses of parliaments summoned in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. Chaucer relates of his
Frankleyn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ful ofte tyme he was a knight of the schire.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was, as Hannay has expressed it, the great gentry who
seem to have accepted the girding of the sword, in something
like turns, as both a dignity and a duty. “From such
men the House of Commons took that high, that <i>gentle</i>
tone, which has often been so justly boasted of by its great
men, and which it is to be hoped it will retain, through
whatever changes are destined for it.” The dignity of
representation in the earlier stages of parliamentary
history does not appear to have extended beyond the
knights of the shires; those of this select order might, if
they had the ambition, contest among themselves, but it
is difficult to imagine electoral contests among the representatives
of a less exalted class&mdash;the citizens and burgesses,
whose election was at first very much at the discretion of
the sheriffs. When the real parliamentary strength lay in
the baronage, the worthies who came up from the cities
and boroughs to advise about taxation were not much
regarded originally, and seem to have conducted themselves,
during their brief visits to the Commons House, with a
docility of demeanour, supposed to be in keeping with their
native obscurity; as, for the most part, they were but
nominees or placemen of Peers and Lords of parliament,
of ecclesiastical hierarchs, of officers of State, or put forward
by lords of manors, influential families, and dispensers of
preferment of one kind or another, a retiring and deferential
line of conduct was due from these mere parliamentary
“pawns” to their patrons. This state of subjection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
appears foreign to the independence by presumption
associated with the character of a member of parliament,
and might be taken as belonging only to a feudal epoch;
but with rare intervals of self-assertion on the part of the
people, such as happened during the civil wars&mdash;when the
equipoise of society was unsettled for a space&mdash;it must be
admitted that at least a considerable portion of the
Commons under the boroughmongering and patronage-monopolizing
days, which reached to 1831, was not far
removed from the condition of semi-vassalage as described,
until the revision and extension of the representative system
assimilated the constitution of the Commons in earnest to
what by a plausible fiction it was “on trust” for generations
assumed to be.</p>

<p>It is shown that in the early days of the representative
system the high obligation of sending members to parliament
was regarded as a burden instead of a privilege by
many boroughs, and that exemption from this duty was
a boon for which sacrifices were cheerfully made; moreover
it was a “right” which constituencies managed to leave
in abeyance, intermitting in many instances for a century
or more. By the same rule, electoral bodies were relieved
to get rid of their responsibilities, before the days of sordid
trafficking, and while venal boroughmongering was still an
undeveloped branch of gain: it was at first accepted by the
cities and boroughs as a kindly service on the part of a
great man to choose the citizens and burgesses for parliament;
“influence” was not considered “undue” when
it was exercised in dictating the choice of what by a traditional
figment were considered the popular representatives.
Thus, in Elizabeth’s reign, quite as a matter of course,
Devereux, Earl of Essex, was busying himself in providing
such nominees as he thought fitting for various places, as
appears from the following letter, addressed to Richard
Bagot, of Staffordshire, and printed with the “Memorials
of the Bagot family,” 1592:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“After my very hartie commendacions. I have written several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
letters to Lichfield, Stafford, Tamworth, and Newcastle for the <i>Nomination</i>
and <i>Election</i> of certain Burgesses for the Parliament to be held very
shortlie; having named unto them, for Lichfield, Sir John Wingfield
and Mr. Broughton. For Stafford, my kinsman Henry Bourgcher,
and my <i>servant</i> Edward Reynolds. For Tamworth, my <i>servant</i> Thomas
Smith. For Newcastle, Dr. James. Whom because I do greatlie
desire to be preferred to the said places, I do earnestlie pray your
furtherance by the credit which you have in those towns.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The mere dealing in “parliamentary interest” was still
undeveloped as regarded its monetary aspect, but party
strengthened its ranks by nominating candidates, first,
because it was the “will and pleasure” of those who held
the influence; secondly, when the possessor of several
boroughs began to realize he could utilize his seats in
many ways, electioneering science took a new departure,
and boroughs and “burgage tenures” began to be cultivated
for the market like any other trafficable commodity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Formerly,” says Waller, “the neighbourhood desired the member
to sit, and there was an end; but now it is a kind of empire. Some
hundred years ago, some boroughs sent not; they could get none to
serve; but now it is a fashion, and a fine thing they are revived.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The ancient system was shaken in the early Stuart
days: under Charles I. we find ministers still writing of
those “seats which were safe,” and where, such as in the
“Cinque Ports,” patronage could secure the election of
placemen; but opposition was ripe in the land, and when
the stand was to be made against the Crown “in many
places the elections were managed with much popular heat
and tumult.” The strength of the Church was matched
against dissent&mdash;“that incredible heresy;” then began
Puritan corporations which exhibited a “factious activity”
in the boroughs, and thus raised to white heat the indignation
of territorial magnates; thence did lords of the manor
bestir themselves for the assertion of traditional privileges,
by easy degenerations swollen into prescriptive rights and
oppressive tyrannies. Hence attempted coercions;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
“certain lord-lieutenants of the counties were accused of making
an improper use of the Train-bands,” the beginning of the
system of electioneering intimidation. Thus we are informed
that, in the year 1639:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In many places the elections were managed with much popular
heat and tumult by the countenance of those English nobility and
gentry of the Scottish faction. At the County election for Essex, for
instance, the Earl of Warwick made good use of his lord-lieutenancy,
in sending letters out to the captains of the Train-bands, who having
power to charge the people with arms, durst not offend, which brought
many to his side. Those ministers who gave their voices for my Lord
of Warwick, as Mr. Marshal and others, preached often out of their
own parishes before the election. Our corporation of Essex, consisting
most of Puritans, and having had their voices in electing their own
burgesses, and then to come to elect knights, is more than the greatest
lord of England hath in their boroughs; the multiplicity of the people
are mean-conditioned, and most factious, and few subsidy-men; and
therefore in no way concerned in the election.</p>

<p>“A man having but forty shillings a year freehold hath as great
a voice in the election as any; and yet this man is never a subsidy-man,
and, therefore, no way concerned in the election for his own
particular; and when the statute was made two centuries earlier (in
1430) forty shillings, it was then twenty pound in value now. And
it were a great quiet to the state if it were reduced to that; and then
gentlemen would be looked upon, and it would save the ministers a
great deal of pains, in preaching from their own churches.”</p></blockquote>

<p>About 1640, although absolute intimidation was not
common, it at least was resorted to in the case of one
candidate, who suffered therefrom, and evidently entered
a subsequent protest. In Nalson’s papers it is recorded:&mdash;“A
paper sent to the Secretary of State by Mr. Nevil, of
Cressing Temple, the unsuccessful candidate, whose life
was threatened. ‘It was said among the people that if
Nevil had the day they would tear the gentleman to
pieces.’” Walpole, otherwise unscrupulous in his resort
to corruption of various kinds, appears to have avoided
downright violence; it was reserved for the Pelhams and
the Duke of Grafton to bring armed force to the hustings
by way of intimidating opposition&mdash;an unsatisfactory state
of affairs which reached its most unconstitutional proportions
under the administration of William Pitt, when those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Court candidates selected from the two services received
the support of both army and navy; when the guards and
sailors surrounded the hustings, and menaced such as were
prepared to record votes for candidates other than their
employers. Much might be written of the struggles in
which envenomed adversaries were led into personal
encounters; and rival factions, as between the Cavaliers
and Roundheads, went to great lengths in their hostilities:
but when the excitement cooled down, the honour of sitting
for a borough did not, as a rule, excite fierce competition,
at least, anterior to the Revolution which dismissed the
Stuarts; members were proposed and accepted in a half-hearted
way, and the burgesses sent to Parliament seemed
little ambitious of the honour.</p>

<p>The method in which a member was selected in the
middle of the seventeenth century for the city of Bath, even
then a place of importance,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> which a short while after
became a celebrated centre for election contests and ministerial
and party intrigues, may be studied with all its
simple minuti&aelig; among the “Nug&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;,” (vol. ii.) prepared
from the family papers of the Harringtons, landed
proprietors in the locality, who, from father to son, had
represented the citizens in successive sessions:&mdash;</p>

PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p>“Dec. 26.&mdash;Went to Bathe and dined with the Mayor and Citizens;
conferred about my election to serve in parliament, as my father was
helpless and ill able to go any more; went to the George Inn at
night, met the Bailiffs, and desired to be dismissed from serving;
drank strong bear and metheglin; expended about iiij<i>s.</i>; went home
late, but could not get excused, as they entertained a good opinion of
my father.</p>

<p>“Dec. 28.&mdash;Went to Bathe; met Sir John Horner; we were chosen
by the Citizens to serve for the city. The Mayor and Citizens conferred
about Parliament business. <i>The Mayor promised Sir John
Horner and myself a horse apiece when we went to London to the Parliament</i>,
which we accepted of....</p>

<p>“Thursday, Dec. 31.&mdash;Went to Bathe; Mr. Ashe preached [this
was before the members, probably in state at the Abbey]. Dined at
the George Inn with the Mayor and 4 citizens; spent vj<i>s.</i> in wine.</p>

<p>The members were salaried at this time, being allowed
from two shillings to three shillings and fourpence, and in
exceptional cases five shillings, per day during the sessions
of the Commons, although in many instances no more than
two shillings was the recognized fee;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> these wages were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
generally raised by the town, and paid in a lump sum at
the close of the sessions.</p>

<p>The writ directs two knights to be chosen out of every
county, two citizens out of every city, and two burgesses
out of every borough. The counties were well known, and
had long been ascertained; but the sheriffs had it left to
their discretion as to the cities and boroughs. They were
the <i>dominic&aelig; civitates</i> and <i>burgi regis</i>, viz. such as had
charters from the king and paid a fee-farm rent in lieu
of the customs and other advantages and royalties that
belonged to the Crown; but these not being named in the
writ, the sheriffs took great liberties, either by summoning
such as had no right, or omitting others, who ought to
have been summoned: this arose from the nature of the
institution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The representation of the nation in parliament was then a
burden to the people, the elected being paid by their electors; nor
doth it appear that the representatives at that time had any advantage
more than their wages. Cities and boroughs were, therefore, not fond
of returning representatives to Parliament, and it was reckoned a
privilege to be exempted, and to obtain which there are more instances
than one of petitions having been presented. Sheriffs would frequently
act in a very partial and arbitrary manner, and out of pique return
many <i>poor boroughs</i>, who were not able <i>to pay their representatives</i>, and
omit others who were able, <i>in order to show favour towards them</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This became a veritable grievance, and, in 5 Rich. 2, a
law was made to hinder these arbitrary proceedings, and
several boroughs were, by charter from the Crown, exempted
from what they would have esteemed a hardship and burden
upon them.</p>

<p>Colchester returned members to Parliament 23 Edward
1; as endorsed upon the writs in 7 Edward 4, only
five burgesses, named in the return, chose for that
Parliament. At that time, service was thought a burden,
and exemption was allowed by way of reward for loyal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
services rendered; thus Richard II., in consideration of
the burgesses of Colchester rebuilding and fortifying the
walls of their town against the king’s enemies, granted
them an exemption for the space of five years.</p>

<p>Beyond the very modest wages allowed by constituencies
to their representatives during their sojourns in London at
the three sessions of parliament, it was generally held a
matter of courtesy to present the two representatives with
a horse apiece to help them on their way; and expenses by
the road, at the allowances stipulated, were added in with
the fixed pay of so much per day for the duration of parliament,
which sum was generally allowed to accumulate, and
redeemed at the close of the session, when the members
came back to report themselves to their constituents and
give an account of their stewardship.</p>

<p>In respect of Middlesex, which has been represented in
parliament from the first general summons of the knights
of the shire in the reign of King Edward I., a reservation
was made. The city of Westminster, where parliament
was usually held, being within this county, the knights had
only their fees for attendance, and no allowance for coming
and going, as in other counties. “In the second year of
King Henry V. (1414), the Bishop of London complained
that his tenants of Fulham were taxed towards the expenses
of the knights of the shire for this county, upon which a
writ was issued for discharging the said tenants, in case it
should appear they had not been formerly taxed.”</p>

<p>The sums paid to members were in all cases very
moderate; but these allowances appear to have varied
even for the same place. The interesting “Extracts from
the Proceedings of Lynn Regis, 1430 to 1731,” as printed in
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i> (vol. xxiv.), supply evidence of the dealings of
that corporation with their parliamentary representatives,
as set down in the “Hall Books.” The parliamentary
warrant was read in the mother-tongue, and sealed after
the election of burgesses to serve in the Commons. The
manner of election by a committee on the jury principle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
seems to have prevailed; thus, in 1433, the king’s writ was
publicly read for electing members of parliament. “And
for electing them the Mayor called two of the twenty-four
(the court of Livery) and two of the common council, which
four chose two more of the twenty-four, and two of the
common council, and they chose four others, who all unanimously
chose John Waterden and Thomas Spicer, to be
Burgesses in Parliament.”</p>

<p>The year previous, the burgesses went to parliament in
May, and returned in July, when, as was customary, a
report was submitted before the mayor as to the manner
in which the corporation had been represented, and how
far its interests had been promoted by the members; when
accounts were compared and a settlement was agreed upon
for wages due, to be raised by a special rate, thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“July 23. John Waterden reported the transactions of Parliament,
at which time was granted by the Corporation half a fifteenth, to be
paid in at two several payments; viz. at Martinmas next, and at
Martinmas then next following. That ye Parliament held from ye 12th
day of May to Thursday next before ye feast of St. Margaret, on which
day ye Parliament ended, and so ye Parliament held for 70 days.
And so there is owing to them, for their appearance for 73 days,
6<i>s.</i> and 8<i>d.</i> for each day, of which they received before their journey or
passage one hundred shillings, and there remains &pound;19 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>From this entry it seems evident that these members
received 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> each. Ten years later, January 10, 1442,
two burgesses were chosen, but, for some unexplained cause,
the fees were lowered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“And it was ye same day ordered, by ye assent of ye whole congregation,
that ye Burgesses chosen for Parliament shall be allowed each
of them two shillings a day and no more.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">At the same time, various instructions were given touching
renewal and confirmation of the Charter; and the
burgesses on their return to Lynn&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“did well and discreetly declare those things which were substantially
done and acted for ye Mayor in ye Parliament.”</p>

<p>“April 18, 1442. The Burgesses of ye last Parliament ingeniously
and seriously related several transactions of ye said Parliament.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p></blockquote>

<p>As a qualification to serve, it was, as a rule, deemed
essential that the member should be “an individual either
bearing office or being resident in the borough,” and persons
residing elsewhere were held inadmissible; thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Feb. 1664. Two letters, one from Sir Robert Hitchin, Kt., ye
other from Sir Henry Spelman, Kt., desiring to be elected Burgesses
for ye next Parliament; forasmuch as ye Statute of ye 1st of Henry 5
(1413) doth appoint that Burgesses should be men residing and free in
ye Borough at ye time of their election, it is agreed to answer their
letter that ye corporation is minded to chuse according to ye Statute.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">In March, the mayor and recorder were straightway elected
burgesses for the next parliament, and enacted under
“June 20. The mayor to have ten shillings per day for
serving in parliament.” This specially high allowance was
possibly due to the extra state which the mayor of a corporation
like King’s Lynn would be expected to support in
the metropolis, to impress the citizens with the consequence
and honour of the borough. The fee speedily dwindled
again, and, in 1642, when the kingdom was in a state of
ebullition, during the Long Parliament, a general prescript
appears to have been instituted as to the fees due to
members, and the possible difficulties of collecting them.
It is thus noted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Oct. 15. An order from ye House of Commons to ye Mayor,
Aldermen, and Common Council, to require them to pay to Mr. Toll
and Mr. Percivall, their Burgesses in Parliament, the same allowance
as formerly per day, being 5<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>“1643, Jan. 3. In answer to ye above order to ye House of
Commons to acquaint them that heretofore no Parliamentary wages
have been paid before ye Parliament ended, nor then out of ye town
stock, but by ye freemen and inhabitants, saving of late of mere bounty
ye Burgesses were diversely rewarded by ye representative body. Also
ye impossibility of performing ye said order, there being no town stock,
ye revenues not being sufficient to defray ye necessary charges in common;
besides, extraordinary expenses unavoidably fall upon us daily
for ye safety of this town and ye kingdom.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rump Parliament, 1649, had abolished the House
of Peers, but some of the Upper Chamber became burgesses
to parliament, and this secured admission to the Commons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Lynn Regis came forward hospitably on this emergency,
and the head of the proud house of Salisbury had reason to
feel grateful for the privilege of being sent to parliament at
a time when the order of Peers was abolished through the
spontaneous suffrages of the people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Jan. 16, 1649. Ordered that a letter be written to ye Right
Honble. ye Earl of Salsbury, by ye Mayor from this house, to give
him knowledge that this house have granted him ye freedom of this
Burgh, and that the <i>comonalty</i> of this Burgh hath elected him a
Burgess of ye Parliament of England.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This honour, which had rarity to recommend it, elicited
a graceful and earnest letter from the new member.</p>

<h3>“THE EARLE OF SALSBURY’S LETTER.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>“As ye precedent you have made in choosing me to be
your Burgess is unusual (I believe), if not ye first among you, so do it
lay ye greater obligation upon me, neither is that favour a little heightened
by my being so much of a stranger to you as indeed I am; and
as you have here an open and free acknowledgment from me of your
kind and good affections in so unanimous an election of me to serve
you in Parliament, as your letter doth express, so cannot they merit or
you expect more thanks than I do really return unto you for them.
You have been pleased cheerfully (as you say) to confer your freedom

not ignorant of the great trust you have placed in me, so shall you

<span class="medium">PARLIAMENTARY LIFE UNDER THE STUARTS; PAID MEMBERS.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The days of the Long Parliament were fruitful in frank
out-of-door expressions of opinion under the rule of
Charles I. and the Commonwealth; but, although political
feelings were embittered, it does not appear that the
franchise was exposed to any undue influence worth recording.
A certain amount of governmental favour was
reckoned of use in isolated instances; this patronage was
considered safe to return nominees for such places as the
Cinque Ports. But few election squibs, pure and simple,
can be discovered before the Restoration. Ballads are less
rare; these for the most part deal with the broader party
relations, and are confined within discreet limitations, for
“privilege of parliament” was rigorously enforced under
Cromwell. On the disappearance of the Commonwealth, the
spirits of the Cavalier wits and rhymsters revived, with
all the more liveliness for their long-enforced repression.
As an animated and characteristic example of the ballads
produced at the close of the stern conventicle <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, we
include the <i>jeux d’esprit</i> written upon the moribund parliament,
when it was no longer formidable,&mdash;dissolution
having, for the time being, shorn its far-reaching and
vengeful claws, while a changed head of the State had
rendered its return to a lease of power extremely problematical.
It is fair to say that, for the most part, the disappearance
of this straight-laced and tyrannical House of
Commons was hailed as a national relief: the theory of
flying “to ills we know not of” had yet to be realized with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the gradual development of the Merry Monarch’s selfish
and ruinous system, the most iniquitous ever tolerated.</p>

</div>

<p>From the pages of Pepys we are reminded that
members of parliament were paid for their services up to
Charles II.’s reign.</p>

<p>It might be expected that the secretary’s “Diary” would
contain some pertinent observation upon elections; he has
set down a good deal upon parliamentary matters that is
curious and enlightening, but the diary ceases in May,
1669, and the more remarkable election contests commenced
later.</p>

<p>Samuel Pepys was evidently as indifferent as were the
courtiers of his day to the relatively vital importance of
the Commons to the State. While accompanying the
reforming member William Prynne, who had accused Sir
G. Carteret of selling places,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> from Whitehall to the
Temple, the diarist in return for the hospitality of his
coach, endeavoured to obtain some information by the way
as to the manner of holding parliaments, and whether the
number of knights and burgesses were always the same.
To which Prynne replied&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“that the latter were not; but that, for aught he can find, they
were sent up at the discretion, at first of the Sheriffs, to whom the
writs were sent to send up generally the Burgesses and citizens of
their county, and he do find that heretofore the Parliament-men, being
paid by the country, several boroughs have complained of the Sheriffs
putting them to the charge of sending up Burgesses.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">This conversation was in January, 1668; in March,
Pepys describes his dining with certain counsel retained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
by creditors of the navy, the secretary having been to
Cursitor Street to arrange assignments on the Exchequer
to the tune of &pound;1,250,000 in favour of these creditors.
The counsel were pleased to flatter Mr. Secretary upon a
recent performance of his in the Parliament House, and,
finding himself with four learned lawyers, Pepys, with his
dinner, enjoyed what he calls “a great deal of good
discourse about parliament”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“their number being uncertain, and always at the will of the king
to increase, as he saw reason to erect a new borough. But all concluded
the bane of the Parliament hath been the leaving off the old
custom of the places allowing wages to those that served them in Parliament,
by which they chose men that understood their business and
would attend it, and they could expect an account from, which now
they cannot, and so the Parliament is become a company of men unable
to give account for the interest of the place they serve for.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Andrew Marvell, member for Hull, who had enjoyed
much experience of men and measures, found fit subject
for satire among the corrupt comrades who now surrounded
him in parliament.</p>

<p>From his “good discourse on parliament,” Mr. Secretary
Pepys, by a happy coincidence, straightway betook
himself to that palace, where he had the privilege of being
well received, and in which, under the Stuarts, more curious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
scenes were witnessed than falls to the lot of even the
average of princely abodes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thence to Whitehall, where the Parliament was to wait on the
King, and they did: and he did think fit to tell them that they might
expect to be adjourned at Whitsuntide, and that they might make
haste to raise their money: but this, I fear, will displease them, who
did expect to sit as long as they pleased.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">A truly regal reception, and a most unceremonious mode
of dismissing the “chosen of the people.” The wits of
the day thus tersely summed up the situation of affairs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ll have a long parliament always to friend,<br /></span>

<p class="author">(<span class="smcap">A. Marvell</span>: <i>Royal Resolutions</i>.)</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most felicitous sallies were due to the pen
of that gifted reprobate, the Earl of Rochester, at times
the <i>alter ego</i> of the Merry Monarch, but who finally, after
enjoying boundless favour by diverting the king at his own
royal expense as often as at that of his subjects, pointed a
shaft with too galling a barb, and flitted away from a
Court whose vileness he both exposed and shared in equally
liberal measure:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Later, Pepys is in conference with the king and the
Duke of York (April, 1668) upon no less a subject than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>“about the Quakers not swearing, and how they do swear
in the business of a late election of a Knight of the Shire of

Hertfordshire in behalf of one they have a mind to have,”
which diverts the monarch mightily.</p>

<p>We have seen how the juris-consultists who lived
contemporaneously with the system of “paid members”
considered the impartiality of representatives was protected
from outside influences by the receipt of a small
independence; later on we find that, owing to a dispute
between the two Chambers, the impression was arrived at
by the Peers that no salaried judges can be deemed impartial,
and that hereditary legislators are the only reliable
tribunals whence unimpeachable justice could be secured.</p>

<p>On a question of privilege between the Lords and
Commons (May, 1668), when the latter took upon themselves
to remedy an error of the Upper Chamber, Lord
Anglesey informed the Commons that the Lords were
“<i>Judices nati et Conciliarii nati</i>, but all other Judges
among us are under salary, and the Commons themselves
served for wages; and therefore the Lords, in reason, were
the freer Judges.”</p>

<p>The circumstance of receiving a salary does not appear
to have compromised the independence of members, but
to the contrary, as they were thus enabled to keep their
honesty the purer, by resisting the venal attacks of the
Court. The integrity of members seems to have suffered
when their fees were no longer recognized. The “Pensioner
Parliament” came into existence precisely at the epoch
when representatives remitted “their wages;” a significant
circumstance, but indicative of the times; when selfishness
usurped the place of patriotism, members sacrificed the
modest retainers designed to keep them honest, that they
might be the less fettered to bargain in their own interests.</p>

<p>The proverbial incorruptibility of Andrew Marvell is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
case in point. This example of a true patriot is erroneously
said to have been the last member who received wages
from his constituents. He died in 1678, M.P. for Hull.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
Others, his contemporaries, maintained the right, and
suffered their arrears to accumulate, as a cheap resource
at the next election. Marvell more than once, in his
correspondence, speaks of members threatening to sue their
boroughs for pay.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Lord Braybrooke, in his notes to
Pepys’s “Diary,” refers to a case, noticed by Lord Campbell
in his “Life of Lord Nottingham,” where the M.P. for
Harwich, in 1681, petitioned the Lord Chancellor, as that
borough had failed “to pay him his wages.” A writ was
issued “De expensis Burgensium levandis.” Lord Campbell
adds, “For this point of the People’s Charter [payment
of wages] no new law is required.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Pepys’s later allusions concern the constantly threatened
dissolutions; in November, 1668, he records, “The great
discourse now is that the Parliament shall be dissolved and
another called, which shall give the King the Dean and
Chapter’s lands, and that will put him out of debt,” concluding
with a hint that the subtle and “brisk” Duke of
Buckingham, at that time the actual ruler of the kingdom,
“does knowingly meet daily with Wildman and other
Commonwealth-men,” the while deceiving Charles into
the belief that his intrigues were of a more tender
nature.</p>

<p>At Whitehall, the same month, Pepys acquires some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
fresh and rather significant information upon the subject
of the Commons; it is imparted to him that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“it was not yet resolved whether the Parliament should ever meet
more or no, the three great rulers of things now standing thus:&mdash;The
Duke of Buckingham<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> is absolutely against their meeting, as moved
thereto by his people that he advises with, the people of the late times,
who do never expect to have anything done by this Parliament for their
religion, and who do propose that, by the sale of the Church lands,
they shall be able to put the King out of debt: my Lord Keeper is
utterly against putting away this and choosing another Parliament,
lest they prove worse than this, and will make all the King’s friends,
and the King himself, in a desperate condition: my Lord Arlington
[being under suspicion, owing to his mismanagement of money in
Ireland] knows not which is best for him, being to seek whether this
or the next will use him worse. It was told me that he believes that
it is intended to call this Parliament, and try them for a sum of money;
and, if they do not like it, then to send them going, and call another,
who will, at the ruin of the Church perhaps, please the King with what
he will have for a time.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">These passages need no comment, the accepted ideas upon
representative government under the House of Stuart
were such as to fill constitutional minds with amazement.
This view is endorsed by a popular ballad of the day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Would you our sov’reign disabuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make his parliament of use,<br /></span>

<p>The inconsistency of the king’s behaviour, and the
triviality of his mind&mdash;when applied to matters of business,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and especially that of parliament&mdash;is happily held up to
ridicule by one of his contemporary wits, who has thus
parodied the expected speech from the throne:&mdash;</p>

<h3>“HIS MAJESTY’S MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH TO BOTH
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>”<span class="smcap">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>“I told you at our last meeting the Winter was the fittest
time for business; and truly I thought so, till my Lord Treasurer
assured me the Spring was the best season for salads and subsidies:
I hope, therefore, that April will not prove so unnatural a month as
not to afford some kind showers on my parched Exchequer, which
gapes for want of them. Some of you perhaps will think it dangerous
to make me too rich; but I do not fear it, for I promise you faithfully
whatever you give me I will always want; and altho’ in other
things my word may be thought a slender authority, yet in that you
may rely upon me, I will never break it.</p>

<p>“My Lords and Gentlemen, I can bear my straits with patience;
but my Lord Treasurer does protest to me, that the Revenue, as it
now stands, will not serve him and me too; one of us must pinch for
it if you do not help me. I must speak freely to you, I am under
circumstances, for, besides my Harlots on service, my reformado
Concubines lie heavy upon me. I have a passable good estate, I
confess; but, Gads-fish, I have a great charge upon’t. Here’s my
Lord Treasurer can tell, that all the money design’d for the next
summer’s guards must of necessity be apply’d to the next year’s
cradles and swaddling clothes. What shall we do for ships then? I
hint this only to you, it being your business, not mine. I know by
experience I can live without ships; I liv’d ten years abroad without,
and never had my health better in my life; but how you will be
without I leave to yourselves to judge, and therefore hint this only
by the by; I don’t insist upon it. There’s another thing I must press
more earnestly, and that is this. It seems a good part of my revenue
will expire in two or three years, except you will be pleased to continue
it. I have to say for’t, Pray why did you give me so much as you
have done, unless you resolve to give on as fast as I call for it? The
nation hates you already for giving so much, and I will hate you too
if you do not give me more; so that if you stick not to me, you must
not have a friend in England. On the other hand, if you will give me
the revenue I desire, I shall be able to do those things for your
Religion and Liberty that I have had long in my thoughts, but cannot
effect them without a little more money to carry me through. Therefore
look to’t, and take Notice that if you do not make me rich enough
to undo you, it shall lie at your doors, for my part I wash my hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
on’t. But that I may gain your good opinion the best way is to
acquaint you what I have done to deserve it out of my royal care for
your religion and your property. For the first, my proclamation is
a true picture of my mind: he that cannot, as in a glass, see my zeal
for the Church of England, does not deserve any farther satisfaction,
for I declare him wilful, abominable, and not good. Some may
perhaps be startled, and cry&mdash;how comes this sudden change? To
which I answer I am a changeling, and that’s sufficient, I think.
But to convince men farther that I mean what I say, there are these
arguments. <i>First</i>, I tell you so, and you know I never break my
word. <i>Secondly</i>, my Lord Treasurer says so, and he never told a lie
in his life. <i>Thirdly</i>, my Lord Lauderdale will undertake it for me,
and I should be loth by any act of mine he should forfeit the credit
he has with you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I must now acquaint you, that by my Lord Treasurer’s Advice,
I have made a considerable retrenchment upon my expenses in Candles
and Charcoal, and do not intend to stop there, but will, with your
help, look into the late embezzlements of my dripping-pans and
kitchen stuff; of which, by the way, upon my conscience, neither my
Lord Treasurer nor my Lord Lauderdale are guilty. I tell you
my opinion, but if you should find them dabbling in that business,
I tell you plainly I leave ’em to you; for I would have the world
know I am not a man to be cheated.</p>

<p>“My Lords and Gentlemen, I desire you to believe me as you
have found me; and I do solemnly promise you, that whatsoever you
give me shall be specially manag’d with the same conduct, trust,
sincerity, and prudence, that I have ever practised since my happy
Restoration.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The commencement of party warfare as now recognized
in parliamentary life may be dated from the Stuarts, and
to account for the designations of Whig and Tory it is
necessary to glance back at the parliamentary troubles of
Charles II., 1679-1680, when that monarch, acting under
the encouragement of Louis XIV., was inclined to make
a misguided attempt to govern without a legislative chamber.
In 1679 the monarch refused a Speaker to his Commons,
finding that functionary obnoxious; and between this date
and 1681 parliament was prorogued seven times: in fact&mdash;as
a summary of Charles II.’s parliaments discloses&mdash;the
discords of the previous reign were revived; the “town and
country party” petitioned zealously for the reassembling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
of parliament, while the Court party counter-petitioned “to
declare their <i>abhorrence</i> of the late tumultuary petitioning.”
Those who were urging on the struggle for popular representation
and freedom were designated <i>Petitioners</i>, the
king’s “friends” were voted “betrayers of the liberties of
the people, and abettors of arbitrary power,” and expressively
stigmatized as <i>Abhorrers</i>;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> from these two
parties, which were ready to exterminate one another,
arose the nicknames of Whigs and Tories, as is explained
in Tindal’s “Rapin.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The “Abhorrers,” who were the mainstay of Charles’s
utterly unconstitutional procedure, although as courtiers
they hoped for their reward from the king, did not get
much tolerance from the Commons: when the parliament
at last reassembled, several members were expelled from
the House on this pretence alone, and they consigned to
the Tower that Sir Francis Withers who had been knighted
for procuring and presenting the loyal address from the
city of Westminster; the majority at the same time
recording, as a gage of battle to their opponents, the
resolution (October, 1680), “That it is the undoubted right
of the subject to petition for the calling of a parliament,
and that to traduce such petitions as tumultuous and
seditious is to contribute to the design of altering the
constitution.” The Tories at that time and long after
maintained the doctrines of “divine hereditary indefeasible
right, lineal succession, passive obedience, prerogative, etc.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>That a determined attitude was felt to be fitting is
exhibited in the protests of the House, printed for circulation,
like the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Wednesday, October 27, 1680.</p>

<p>“Two Unanimous votes of this present Honourable and Worthy
Parliament concerning the subjects’ rights in Petitioning.</p>

<h4>”<i>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente</i>,&mdash;</h4>

<p class="noindent">That it is and ever hath been the undoubted Right of the subjects
of England to petition the King for calling and sitting of parliaments,
and redressing of Grievances.</p>

<h4>“<i>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente</i>,&mdash;</h4>

<p class="noindent">That to traduce such Petitioning is a violation of duty, and to
represent it to his Majesty as Traitorous and seditious, is to betray
the Liberty of the Subjects, and contributes to the design of subverting
the ancient, legal Constitution of this Kingdom, and the Introducing
Arbitrary Power.</p>

<p>”<i>Ordered</i>&mdash;That a Committee be appointed to enquire of all those
Persons as have offended against these Rights of the subject.</p>

<p>“London: Printed for Francis Smith, Bookseller, at the Elephant
and Castle, near the Royal Exchange in Cornhill.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Francis Smith was the publisher&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“who suffered a Chargeable Imprisonment in the Gaol of Newgate,
in December last, for printing and promoting Petitions for the Sitting
of this present Parliament.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">He is referred to with acrimony in the ballads by Tantivy
and courtier bards, among the “pestiferous crew of republican
scribes.”</p>

<p>Charles’s first parliament was, amid the confusion of
the time (the revolution subverted and royalty restored),
barely constituted; it lasted from April 25, 1660, to December
29th, and, being assembled without the king’s writ, was,
with customary royal ingratitude for “past favours,” considered
by Charles as the <i>Convention</i> Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The
long <i>Cavalier Parliament</i>, some portion of which, like the
king, was in the pay of Louis XIV., is stigmatized to
posterity as the “Pensionary” Parliament; it met May 8,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
1661, and lasted until January 24, 1679; the members
were doubly corrupt, accepting money-bribes or lucrative
offices from the Court, or being, according to Barillon’s
clear declarations, in the pay of France and Holland, as
regarded the patriotic members, who fiercely denounced
the venality of the Court. In 1675 the oath against
bribery was opportunely inaugurated, providing against
corruption either from the Crown or from any ambassador
or foreign minister. The Pensionary Parliament, which
began its career by servile loyalty, and was merciless
against Republicans, towards its close opposing the unreasonable
extension of prerogative became factious and
insubordinate, arrogating to itself the control of legal procedure,
and, according to the opinions of extreme Royalists,
generally proving itself a “scourge.”</p>

<p>The popular view of this venal legislature is given in
the following version:&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles II.’s third, or <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Parliament, showed
a determination to exceed its predecessor in opposing the
Court, and seemed ambitious of imitating that of 1640, the

times:&mdash;</p>

whole country was in commotion during August and

<p>The newly elected parliament, the materials of which
were equally unpalatable to the Court party, was summoned
to meet in October, 1679, but, prorogued during the
royal pleasure, it did not actually meet until October 21,
1680. The interval was marked by the presentation of
loyal addresses and petitions for its reassembling. Further
prorogued on the 10th of January, it was dissolved
on the 18th, to be followed by the “Oxford Parliament”
of eight days, which was dissolved on March 28, 1681.
The nation saw itself on the verge of civil war, and,
remembering what it had suffered&mdash;while opposing the
encroachments of the Crown and autocratic exactions&mdash;from
the opposite extremes of anarchy and fanaticism,
the people were resigned to temporize, and thus Charles
was allowed to rule without a parliament until his death.</p>

<p>The following satire is well-founded, and pertinent to
the prevalent state of affairs:&mdash;</p>

of the Merry Monarch. The rhymster, after rehearsing
the sufficient reasons why every month, from January to
December, is unfitted, according to the royal inclinations,

<p>The political squibs of this time are chiefly written
by Cavaliers, and give a one-sided view, from which, however,
much may be gathered. Though not actually election
addresses, they refer to the claims which the electors of
the kingdom found themselves constrained to address to
the throne.</p>

<p>Among the collection of “Bagford Ballads,” so capably
edited and illustrated by J. W. Ebsworth, M.A.,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> is a group
of parliamentary election ballads, apparently of the date
1679-80, and relating to Essex, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire,
and the Universities. The Titus Oates plot; the
Duke of York and his threatened exclusion from the succession;
the impeachment by the Commons of a secretary
of State, of Lord Danby, lord-treasurer; with the opposing
designs of the Papists and the rabid Dissenters; and, above
all, the petitions and the counter-petitions, seem the leading
topics of these satires: but they do not contain much
enlightenment upon elections, pure and simple. “The
Essex Ballad,” humorously explains the <i>modus operandi</i>
of the “abhorred” petitions.</p>

<p class="noindent">The members representing Buckingham town in the fourth
parliament of Charles II., 1679, were Lord Latimer and Sir
Richard Temple.</p>

<p>The Buckingham ballad, “The Sale of Esau’s Birthright,”
which relates to these members, is interesting
from an electioneering point, as proving bribery, and as
showing there were only thirteen electors of this limited
constituency concerned in this particular return. Six
voted, according to a list at the end of the ballad, “for
their king and country,” and seven for Lord Latimer and
Sir <i>Timber</i> Temple (the Earl of Danby, in another version),
“for popery and their Town Hall” (“Sir R. T. his Timber,
Chimney-money and Court,” according to another version).
It seems certain that Sir Richard Temple had offered a
present of timber for the Town Hall&mdash;in fact, some years
later he is called “Timber Temple” (“State Poems”)&mdash;which
was regarded as a bribe; it also appears that some
delay had arisen in its payment.</p>

not only did the Whigs the favour to hate them cordially,
but, as their own satires abundantly demonstrate, they
also dreaded and feared them not a little.</p>

of overstrained prerogative and those who upheld the
popular rights of representation against absolute monarchy;

<h3>“PLAIN DEALING,</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Or a Second Dialogue between Humphrey and Roger, as they were
returning home from choosing Knights of the Shire to sit in Parliament</i>.</p>

<p class="copy">(PRINTED FOR T. B.)</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Well overtook, neighbour. I see you are not a man of your
word; did you not promise me, when we last met, that you would
vote for our old members, that sat in the last Parliament, to be
Knights of the Shire, to sit in the parliament at Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> I thought to do so, but, by my brown cow, I have
been over-persuaded to the contrary by my Landlord and his Chaplain,
<i>Mr. Tantivie</i>, and a pestilent fine man, I think they said he was a
courtier, that lay at my Landlord’s house; and what with arguments
and wine, they drew aside my heart, and made me vote against my
conscience.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> ’Twas ill done, neighbour <i>Numps</i>, but all their artifices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
would not do, we have carried it by some hundreds for our old
members, that stood so bravely for their country.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> I am glad of it with all my heart, for, to tell you truly,
tho’ my landlord had my voice, the old members had my heart, and
I’ll never do so again.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> I hear most of the Counties in England are of the same
mind, and all the Burgess Towns, Cities, and Corporations; but what
arguments could they use to alter thy mind?</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> First, I say, they made me continually drunk, and
then my Landlord asked me so very civilly, and gave me so many
good words, and fine promises what a kind Landlord he would be,
that I forgot all your instructions; and methought he had invincible
arguments to persuade me.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> What were they?</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> Nay, I have forgot them; but I thought no Counsellor-at-Law,
nor any Bishop, could have contradicted them: I now
remember one argument that took with me; you know I was ever for
the King, and he told me the King did not love the old Parliament-men,
and therefore I should not vote for them; but I, being bold,
asked him how he knew that.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> What said he then?</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> Why he laid me as flat as a flounder, that is, he fully
convinced me, for, said he, if the King had loved them he would not
have dissolved them. I think that was demonstrable.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> ’Tis no matter, tho’ the King did not love them, they lov’d
you and your country, and you should so far have loved yourself, as
not to have betrayed your own interest. What said the Courtier?</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> ‘Faith he said not much to me, but I suppose he had
said enough to my Landlord.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> And was this all your Landlord said to you? Had you
nothing to say for yourself? You spoke rationally the last time we
were together.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> Nay, I was forward enough to speak I’ll assure you;
and I told them I was sure our old members would be for the rooting
up of Popery, and would stand stiffly against Arbitrary Government.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> What said they then?</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> My Landlord laughed at me, and told me I had been
among the <i>Presbyterian Whigs</i>, and bid me have a care of being
cheated into Rebellion, by those two words <i>Popery</i> and <i>Arbitrary
Government</i>. Then he showed me a printed paper, I think he called
it <i>The Mistress of Iniquity</i>, which showed as plain as the nose on my
face, that in ’41 they did as we do now, and by that means they
brought one King to the block, and so they would now do by our
present Sovereign, God bless him.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Alas! alas! and that frighted you, did it?</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> Frighted me, ay marry did it, and I think ’twould
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
affright any honest man; you know I was always a King’s man, and
I would be taught to join with those, or give my Voice for such, who,
under the notion of crying against Popery and Arbitrary Government,
would pull down the King and the Bishops, and set up a Commonwealth
again.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Well, <i>Numps</i>, I believe thee to be an honest man, and there
be many in this land of thy condition, that are not of any great reach
in policies and tricks of State Mountebanks, and so may be easily
persuaded, upon false grounds, to betray your country, your liberties,
your lives, and religion.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> Nay, that was not all; he then read another printed
paper, with a hard name, I think it was <i>Hercules Rideing</i>, or something
of jest and earnest which I laughed heartily at, and methought
there were some things called ‘<i>Querks</i>,’ which made a jingling and
noise in my ears, that I thought there was some spell in it, for it
seemed to join with <i>Mistress Iniquity</i>, to make all the Presbyterians
traitors, and most of the people of England mad and factious.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> There is as much heed to be given to these pamphlets as to
the jingling of Morrice-bells. They are hired to set the people
together by the ears, and are Papists in masquerade; things set up
to affright the people out of their senses, with the buy leave of ’41;
wise men see through them, honest men are not affrighted at them,
and fools and knaves only are led aside by them.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> But don’t we do now as formerly, before the late wars?
don’t we run in just the same steps as they did, who caused all the
late bloody doings, as those pamphlets would make us believe?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> I cannot tell what they mean by roads and highways; pray
Hodge, we are now riding in the High-road to the next market-town;
before the last Assizes, in this very road three or four Highwaymen
rode in it too, and robbed several persons, and committed many
villainous murders, and were at last caught and hanged for it; now
therefore, because we are riding in the same Highway, must we
honest men be accounted thieves, robbers, and murderers, and all
others who travel this road? that’s a hard case.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> You say right, neighbour Hodge, tho’ the gallows
stand in the highway, we need not run our Heads against it, nor do
anything to deserve it.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Shall not the people who feel the burden and groan under
the oppression, and, having no other way of redress but a parliament,
desire and petition for one, and cry out against such illegal and unjust
proceedings, but presently they must be termed by these fellows
seditious, factious, and such as would dethrone the King, and pull
down the Bishops? Then all men must hereafter be afraid to speak,
to vote, or to petition against grievances, lest they should be termed
rebels, villains, and traitors.</p>

<p><i>Humphrey.</i> O neighbour, my heart trembles! what a rogue was I
to vote at random, when our all lies at stake! I did not think we had
put such a trust into the hands of our Parliament-men; I thought,
alas, as many do, that we chose only for form-sake, and that they
were only called to Parliament to give the King money, and to do
what he would have them; and we have paid so many taxes already,
and given so much money, that I wished in my heart there would be
no more parliaments in my days.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> You see you were mistaken; ’tis the greatest trust that can
be put into the hands of men, when we send to the parliament our
representatives, for we entrust them with our religion, lives, liberties,
and property, all we have; for they may preserve them to us, give
them from us, and therefore, neighbour, we ought to be careful in
whom we put this great trust, and not be persuaded by our Landlord
or any flattering Courtier, or ‘<i>horn-winding Tantivie</i>’ of them all,
to choose those whom we know not, and are not well assured of, and
that we dare not confide in.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Equally sound in argument is the following:&mdash;</p>

<h3>“A SPEECH WITHOUT DOORS MADE BY A PLEBEIAN
TO HIS NOBLE FRIENDS.</h3>

<p class="copy">(PRINTED FOR B. T. 1681.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Parliaments have been wont to take up some space at the first
Meetings to settle the House, and to determine of unlawful elections,
and in this point they never had greater cause to be circumspect
than at this time: For by an abuse lately crept in, there is introduced
a custom, which, if it be not seen and prevented, will be a great
derogation of the honour, and a weakening of the power of your
House, where the law giveth a freedom to Corporations to elect
Burgesses, and forbiddeth any indirect course to be taken in their
Elections, many of the Corporations are so base-minded and timorous,
that they will not hazard the indignation of a Lord Lieutenant’s letter,
who, under-hand, sticks not to threaten them, if he hath not the
Election of the Burgesses, and not they themselves.</p>

<p>And commonly those that the Lords recommend are such as desire
it for protection, or are so ignorant of the place they serve for, as
that there being occasion to speak of the Corporation for which they
are chosen, they have asked their neighbours sitting by, whether it
were a sea or a land town?</p>

<p>The next thing that is required is <i>Liberty of Speech</i>, without which
Parliaments have little force or power; speech begets doubts, and
resolves them; and doubts in speeches beget understanding; he that
doubts much, asketh often, and learns much; and he that fears the
worst, soonest prevents a mischief.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>This privilege of speech is anciently granted by the testimony
of Philip Cominus, a stranger,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> who prefers our parliaments, and
the freedom of the subject in them, above all other Assemblies;
which Freedom, if it be broken or diminished, is negligently lost
since the days of Cominus.</p>

<p>If Freedom of Speech should be prohibited, when men with
modesty make repetition of the grievances and enormities of the
kingdom; when men shall desire Reformation of the wrongs and
injuries committed, and have no relation of evil thoughts to his
Majesty, but with open heart and zeal, express their dutiful and
reverent respect to him and his service; I say, if this kind of Liberty
of Speech be not allowed in time of Parliaments, they will extend
no farther than to Quarter-Sessions, and their Meetings and Assemblies
will be unnecessary, for all means of disorder now crept in, and all
remedies and redresses will be quite taken away.</p>

<p>As it is no manners to contest with the King in his Election of
his Councillors and servants (for Kings obey no men, but their laws),
so it were a great negligence, and part of Treason, for a subject not
to be free in speech against the abuses, wrongs, and offences that
may be occasioned by Persons in authority. What remedy can be
expected from a prince to a subject, if the enormities of the kingdom
be concealed from him? or what King so religious and just in his
own nature, that may not hazard the loss of the hearts of his subjects,
without this Liberty of Speech in Parliament? For such is the misfortune
of most princes, and such is the happiness of subjects where
Kings’ affections are settled, and their loves so far transported to
promote servants, as they only trust and credit what they shall inform.</p>

<p>In this case, what subject dares complain? or what subject dares
contradict the words or actions of such a servant, if it be not warranted
by Freedom of a Parliament, they speaking with humility? for nothing
obtaineth favour with a King, so much as diligent obedience.</p>

<p>The surest and safest way betwixt the King and his people, which
hath the least scandal of partiality, is, with indifference, and integrity,
and sincerity, to examine the grievances of the Kingdom, without
touching the person of any man, further than the cause giveth the
occasion: for otherwise, you shall contest with him that hath the
prince’s ears open to hearken to his enchanting tongue, he informs
secretly, when you shall not be admitted to excuses, he will cast your
deserved malice against him, to your contempt against the King; and
so will make the prince the shield of his revenge.</p>

<p>These are the sinister practices of such servants to deceive their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Sovereigns; when our grievances shall be authentically proved, and
made manifest to the world by your pains to examine and freedom
to speak. No prince can be so affectionate to a servant, or such an
enemy to himself, as not to admit of this indifferent proceeding: if
his services be allowable and good, they will appear with glory; if
bad, your labour shall deserve thanks both of Prince and country.</p>

<p>When justice shall thus shine, people will be animated to serve
their King with integrity; for they are naturally inclined to imitate
their princes in good or bad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If any man shall pervert this good meaning and motion of yours,
and inform his Majesty, <i>’Tis a Derogation from his Honour to yield to
his subjects upon Conditions</i>, his Majesty shall have good cause to prove
such men’s eyes malicious and unthankful, and thereby to disprove
them in all their outer actions; for what can it lessen the reputation
of a Prince whom the subject only and wholly obeyeth, that a <i>Parliament</i>
which his Majesty doth acknowledge to be his highest Council,
should advise him, and he follow the advice of such a Council? What
dishonour rather were it to be advised and ruled by one Councillor alone,
against whom there is just one exception taken of the whole Commonwealth?</p>

<p>Marcus Portio saith, that that Commonwealth is everlasting,
where the Prince seeks to get obedience and love, and the subjects
to gain the affection of the Prince; and that Kingdom is unhappy
where their Prince is served out of ends and hope of reward, and
hath no other assurance of them but their service.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The substitution of Oxford, “the hot-bed of Toryism,”
for Westminster as the place of assembly for what proved
Charles II.’s last parliament, was violently opposed by
the members, who naturally resented this royal manœuvre
of cutting off the representatives from the protection of
the citizens. A petition remonstrating against the change
was presented by Essex and sixteen other Peers; this
darkly set forth dangers to the Crown, and reminded the
king of the disasters which had always followed similar
departures from the rule of London parliaments. Charles
frowned, but took no heed. The parliament, forced into
submission, attended at Oxford, Shaftesbury and other
adherents taking with them a body-guard of armed retainers,
citizens of London, wearing the Association green ribbons,
with the legend, “No Popery: no Slavery!”

<p>Parliament met March 21, 1681. Of its short existence
of eight days, three were consumed in formalities,
the choice of a Speaker, and other preliminaries. The
course of the action of the members was predetermined.
They were to insist on the banishment and exclusion of
the Duke of York from the succession. The impeachment
was to be proceeded with of Fitz-Harris, who was imprisoned
and awaiting trial, on an information of Everard, for being
the author of a treasonable libel; it was understood, or
at least expected, that the Duchess of Portsmouth and
others of the Court would be implicated in his confession.
The Lords voted that he should be proceeded against at
Common Law, by which decision the Commons were
craftily involved in a struggle for privilege and power
with the Peers, who were also less impatient than themselves
to carry the Exclusion Bill, the Lower House resolving
that “it is the undoubted right of the Commons in
parliament assembled to impeach before the Lords in
parliament any Peer or Commoner for treason or any
other crime or misdemeanour; and that the refusal of the
Lords to proceed in parliament upon such impeachment
is a denial of justice and a violation of the constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>This squabble between the two branches of the legislature
exactly answered the king’s occasions; he made this
a pretence for again dissolving the parliament, thus saving
his brother and the Duchess of Portsmouth from the designs
of the Commons. As it was, Charles coolly dismissed them
as impracticable and useless, telling them, “he perceived
there were great heats between the Lords and Commons,
and their beginnings had been such as he could expect
no good success of this parliament, and therefore thought
fit to dissolve them.” This was on the 28th of March.
On this point the Rev. J. W. Ebsworth, M.A., who has
edited the “Bagford Ballads,” which illustrate the last years
of the Stuarts, remarks&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Had they been in London, there can be no doubt they would
have resisted, calling the City to support them, and voted themselves
permanent, to the defiance of the King and a commencement of civil
war. He saw their plan, and conquered them.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">It was the lesson of “forty-one” to be taught again,
as was prophetically hinted by “the ghost of the late
Parliament to the New One to meet at Oxford.” In reference
to the tyranny of the Commons, as opposed to the
absolutism of the Crown, we find a <i>Loyal Poem</i>, entitled&mdash;</p>

<span class="medium">PARLIAMENTS AND ELECTIONEERING UNDER JAMES II., WILLIAM
III., AND QUEEN ANNE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">With the accession of James II. a fresh era of parliament
commences. It was the first object of the newly proclaimed
king to secure a liberal allowance, settled for life, such as
would make him independent of “his faithful Commons.”
His late brother having attempted to govern without that
section of the legislature in which is vested the control of
supplies, was, towards the close of his reign, getting to the
end of his resources, derived from foreign pensions for the
most part. Evelyn records that within a month of Charles’s
death a parliament was summoned, and “great industry
used to obtain elections which might promote the Court
interest, most of the Corporations being now, by their new
charters, empowered to make what return they pleased.”
These liberties were, however, restored in the nature of
bribes, the new charters granted by the Court being held as
considerations for the election of such as were reckoned in
the interests of that faction. Evelyn himself discloses this
damaging fact: “It was reported that Lord Bath carried
down with him into Cornwall no fewer than fifteen charters,
so that some called him the ‘Prince Elector.’” This was
an “electioneering job” on a gigantic scale, and the new
parliament seems to have been returned on these corrupt
principles where it was possible. On the same authority,
we are enlightened concerning another piece of electioneering
strategy, which proves that, as Praed has wittily told
in verse, expediency has ever been proved the ruling policy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
on both sides. Under the 8th of April, 1685, the diary
records&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This day my brother of Wotton and Mr. Onslow were candidates
for Surrey against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin Sir Edward Evelyn,
and were circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff’s,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
taking advantage of my brother’s party going out of the small village
of Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being tempestuous,
proceeding to the election when they were gone, they expecting
the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured. The Duke of Norfolk
led Sir Edward Evelyn’s and Sir Adam Brown’s party. For this
Parliament very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen’s
servants, clerks, and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were
set up; but the country would choose my brother whether he would
or no, and he missed it by the trick above-mentioned. Sir Adam
Brown was so deaf that he could not hear one word. Sir Edward
Evelyn<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> was an honest gentleman, much in favour with his majesty.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 22nd of May, 1685, the new king met his
parliament (with his crown on his head), and the Commons
being introduced to the House of Lords, read his speech, to
the effect that he resolved to call a parliament from the
moment of his brother’s decease, as the best means to settle
all the concerns of the nation; that as he would invade no
man’s property, so he would never depart from his own
prerogative; and that as he would take care of <i>their</i> religion
and property,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“so he doubted not of suitable returns of his subjects’ duty and kindness,
especially as to settling his revenues for life, for the many weighty
necessities of government, which he would not suffer to be precarious;
that some might possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply
him from time to time only, out of their inclination to frequent parliaments;
but that that would be a very improper method to take with
him, since the best way to engage him to meet oftener would be always
to use him well, and therefore he expected their compliance speedily,
that this session being but short, they might meet again to satisfaction;”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">a speech which, in spite of its palpable duplicity, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
received with acclamation by the House. “So soon as
the Commons were returned, and had put themselves into
a Grand Committee, they immediately put the question,
and unanimously voted the revenue to his Majesty for life.”
This ready subserviency is explained, as it transpires, from
Evelyn’s account, that the new members were not all that
could be desired:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“Mr. Seymour made a bold speech against many of the elections; and
would have had those members who (he pretended) were obnoxious, to
withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being legally returned:
but no one seconded him. The truth is, there were many of
the new members whose elections and returns were universally censured,
many of them being persons of no condition, or interest in the nation,
or places for which they served, especially in Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk,
etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and from the effect
of the new charters changing the electors, as in Lord Bath’s famous
western tour, when that nobleman is said to have quietly put down
the names of all the officers of the Guards into the charters of the
Cornwall boroughs; whence Seymour told the House in his speech that
if this was digested, they might introduce what religion and laws they
pleased, and that though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies
of the people before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.</p>

<p>“By the printed list of members, of 505 there did not appear to be
above 135 who had been in former Parliaments, especially that lately
held at Oxford.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the same date, 1685, Burnet mentions that complaints
came up from all parts of England of the injustice
and violence used in elections.</p>

<p>James II. got on no better with his parliaments than his
predecessor; on his abdication at the Revolution, a convention
parliament was assembled, which ratified the late
changes, and offered the sovereignty to William of Orange
and Mary his consort. The political squibs upon this topic
are not wanting in point:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Whigs, who had effected the Revolution which
placed William III. on the throne, were now in the enjoyment
of place and power, to the mortification of the discomfited
Tories, whose vexation on the aspect of affairs,
which gave them no prospect of a return to office, found
expression in satirical attacks upon their more successful
adversaries.</p>

<p>A poetic effusion, one of the relics of a parliamentary
election in the reign of William III., was printed in 1701.
It is entitled “The Election, a Poem,” and evidently describes
an election for the city of London; the scene of the
incident is the Guildhall, where the electoral struggle was
fought out beneath the shelter of the civic guardians, Gog
and Magog. This production, redolent of the savour of
the seventeenth century, is interesting as displaying the
nature of “election squibs” under an early guise. The
poem opens with a brief introduction of the principal performers,
and alludes to the scene of the contest.</p>

<p>The bard describes the “City Godmother,” an obsolete

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">“She saw the temper of the noisy Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wept the Churches’ stars that downwards fall.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In vain does the antique beldame recall the “bad old
times” of fanaticism and oppression (when in a former
reign the civic charters were taken away perforce), and
exhort the sympathies of the crowd to turn from Whiggism
and embrace the abuses of the Stuarts:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The author first introduces the candidates who were
obnoxious to him, and he certainly roasts them royally,
and serves with a right pungent sauce. Priso, the first
candidate to appear before the freeholders, had degraded
himself as a tool of the late Court, and when in possession
of the chair had basely surrendered the liberties of the city
corporation.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Candidate number two, Child, was, it is hinted, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
interests of the “prince over the water,” whom he was
hopeful of converting from popery.</p>

<p>The sentiments put into the mouths of the candidates
contain enlightenment upon city matters, as well as upon
prominent citizens, both under the reign of William III.
and his predecessors from the Restoration. Another candidate
is thinly disguised under the nickname of “the Czar.”
He is made to thus candidly address the “medley voting
crowd:”&mdash;</p>

<p>One of the forty-nine verses of which “The University
Ballad” consists contains an allusion to an important
collision between the two Chambers upon disputed elections,
which came about in Queen Anne’s reign:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O! how were we blinded with what some do write,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning the story of Ashby and White,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Sir H[eneage] laid before us the fallacy, in sight.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The names first given refer to the disputants, while Sir
H&mdash;&mdash; in all probability is one of the University’s parliamentary
representatives, Sir Heneage Finch, son of Finch,
Lord Keeper and Chancellor. He was returned in 1678,
1688, 1695, and also in 1701 and 1702. The important
dispute in question, which is not without interest, as it
bears a special reference to election practices which were
at one time prevalent, arose between the Lords and Commons
on the occasion of the Aylesbury returns, and the
case came before parliament in 1703-4. It seems to have
been the tactics of those persons whose party held a majority
in the House, to decide all disputed elections so as to
strengthen their own side. “The majority,” meaning the
government, legislated thus partially, conveniently ignoring
the energetic protests against such flagrant injustice&mdash;the
condonation of direct bribery and downright perjury, according
to the allegations of the minority; who, it is said, when
the turn of the wheel came which raised them to power,
invariably endorsed the policy of their predecessors by
repeating the same evil practices. The investigation
brought to light the illegitimate nature of election returns,
proving that it had long been the habit of constables and
similar officials to secure for such candidates as would
pay them sufficiently, their return for parliament by obtaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
a majority of votes for the person who purchased
their connivance: thus, after the seat was, in advance, put
up to the highest bidder, pains were taken to ascertain in
whose favour each vote was likely to be given; those
burgesses who were not to be cajoled or bribed into voting
for the candidate adopted by the constables were prevented
from voting otherwise, under various pretexts by which they
were disabled or disfranchised,&mdash;an oppression which reduced
representative government to a mere pretence. Yet,
although these glaring illegalities were patent, they had
offered such temptations as to have been condoned successively
by either party in power.</p>

<p>At length the evils of this system were forced upon the
attention of the legislature, as certain burgesses of Aylesbury
(Bucks) resisted the authority of the venal officers
which had prevailed unchallenged hitherto, and at length
brought a criminal action against William White and other
constables of the borough. One Matthew Ashby had been
permitted to vote at previous elections, but on the recent
occasion was denied the privilege, as his vote happened to
be in favour of the candidate who had not secured the official
interest. The trial came on, and proved a complicated affair.
The constables lost the day at the assizes, being cast in
damages. Brought before the Queen’s Bench, a majority of
two judges supported the constables, although the third,
Chief Justice Holt, was opposed to them. The House of
Lords reversed this judgment, confirming the award of the
assizes. The Commons grew indignant with the Peers at
threatened encroachments, and voted that Ashby, in prosecuting
his action, had committed “a breach of privilege”&mdash;that
delicate offence so swiftly and severely visited with
condemnation. Lastly, the Lords fulminated their censures
on the Commons for crying injustice; at their order the Lord
Keeper sent “a copy of the case and of their resolutions
to all the Sheriffs of England, to be communicated to all the
Boroughs in their counties,” enlightening all concerned
upon prevailing malpractices, and serving as a caution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
for the future&mdash;a proceeding highly provoking to the Commons,
who were powerless to hinder it. They turned their
indignant wrath upon the five burgesses of Aylesbury, who
followed suit to Ashby, against White: when their actions
were brought against the borough constables, as returning
officers, for the refusal of their votes, “the House of
Commons, on plea of breach of privilege, committed the
five to Newgate, where they lay imprisoned three months.”
By a curious turn of the tables, when their trial came on at
the Queen’s Bench, Chief Justice Holt declared they ought
to be discharged, but, being remanded, the prisoners were
removed into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, and the
Commons were covered with disgrace by the after-proceedings.
The dilemma was obviated by the queen interfering
with a prorogation, followed by a dissolution on the 5th of
April, 1705, which thus concluded the last session of Queen
Anne’s first parliament.</p>

<p>The “loyal Tackers,” who fought so hard to get their
own way under the easy sovereignty of their “gracious
Anna,” were occasionally treated to hard rubs by their
opponents, the stedfast Whigs, whose prospects again
brightened at the close of Anne’s reign.</p>

<p>In 1695, the legislature passed a severe act against
bribery and treating, the first of a series of similar preventative
measures which have been found requisite from
time to time down to our own day.</p>

<p>That this act was needed is proved by the records of
the immense sums expended in corrupting the suffrage.
Addison’s patron, Thomas, Marquis of Wharton, is calculated
to have spent eighty thousand pounds of his own
fortune in electioneering. This spirited nobleman, who
was one of the most energetic Whigs, and largely instrumental
in bringing over the Prince of Orange, has been
regarded as the greatest adept at electioneering which
England ever saw, and, says Hannay, “may pass as the
patriarch of the art in this country.” It is certain that
his abilities were admirably adapted to the purpose of
exercising this control. It was his policy “to forward the
designs of an oligarch by the attraction of a demagogue,”
a branch of higher art, which has had imitators in this
age. He managed to return from twenty to thirty
members, at an expenditure of thousands, backed by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
happy persuasive knack of carrying all before him. Nor
did he stop at an occasional duel by the way. In the general
election of 1705 alone, he spent twelve thousand pounds.
But cash, pluck, enterprise, and activity would have been
less conspicuous had they not been supplemented by what
has been called a “born genius for canvassing,” as is
proved from the “Memoirs” which appeared shortly after
his death in 1715. Wharton’s biographer introduces the
subject of an electoral contest for the borough of Wicombe,
at the beginning of Anne’s reign. His Whig lordship
having recommended two candidates of his own choice,
the staunch Church party, in a flutter of indignation, put
up two High Tory candidates, and money was freely spent
on both sides. A friend of one of the High Church candidates
being desirous of witnessing the progress made by
this canvasser, was invited down to Wicombe to watch the
proceedings, and it was he who imparted the details to
the compiler of the “Memoirs.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The “Tantivy” party
arrived to find my Lord Wharton before them, accompanied
by his two <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>, going up and down the town securing
votes for the Whig interest. The Tory candidates and a
very few followers marched on one side of the street, Lord
Wharton’s candidates and a great company on the other.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The gentleman, not being known to my lord or the townsmen,
join’d with his lordship’s men to make discoveries, and was by when
my lord, entering a shoemaker’s shop, asked ‘where Dick was.’ The
good woman said ‘her husband was gone two or three miles off with
some shoes, but his lordship need not fear him&mdash;she would keep him
tight.’ ‘I know that,’ says my lord, ‘but I want to see Dick and
drink a glass with him.’ The wife was very sorry Dick was out of the
way. ‘Well,’ says his lordship, ‘how does all thy children? Molly
is a brave girl I warrant by this time.’ ‘Yes, I thank ye, my lord,’
says the woman: and his lordship continued&mdash;‘Is not Jemmy breeched
yet?”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">This conversation convinced the witness that his friend’s
chances were hopeless in opposing a great Peer who could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
display such an intimate knowledge of the electors and
their families. To the said marquis does Dr. Percy
attribute the famous Irish ballad of “Lillibulero,” which
is said to have had effects more powerful than the
philippics of Demosthenes or the orations of Cicero, and
certainly contributed not a little towards the revolution
in 1688.</p>

<p>In the days of Queen Anne, the arrival of a popular
candidate of the High Tory type was welcomed in a stately
manner by the supporters of the “Church” cause, as
appears from “Dyer’s Letters.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“May 5th.&mdash;From Exon, we have an account of the honourable
reception there of John Snell, Esq., one of the representatives in the
late parliament, an honest, loyal, and brave <i>Tacker</i>, who arrived from
London on the 1st inst., having been met some miles out of town by
above 500 horse and some 1000 foot, composed of the neighbouring
gentry, with the clergy, aldermen, and principal citizens; who conducted
him to his own house with the city music playing before him,
the streets echoing with these acclamations&mdash;‘<span class="smcap">God bless the loyal
Tackers, and send the Sneakers more honesty and courage.</span>’”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">According to the Tories, all who were opposed to the
“Tackers” of their order must be stigmatized to the public
as “Sneakers.”</p>

<p>The Whigs were equally unscrupulous in the audacity
of their assertions; the fatally damaging effect of a startling
calumny, no matter how improbable, so that it be bold
enough, exploded on an opponent by way of surprise&mdash;a
resource much relied upon when matters looked desperate
at these times of unsparing warfare&mdash;is illustrated in the
next extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“May 15th.&mdash;The Lord Woodstock, son of the Earl of Portland,
has carried it at Southampton against Fred Tilney, Esq., a loyal and
worthy gentleman, which was done by this trick:&mdash;that gentleman
happening to pay his reckoning in that town with about 70 Loudores,
which he had received there, <i>the Whig party immediately gave out he
was a French pensioner, which calumny answered their purpose</i>.”</p>

<p>“May 29th.&mdash;Since my last, we have had an account of several
elections, which I leave to the Gazette to enumerate: only the management
of some of them is worth notice, particularly for the county
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
of Worcester, where Sir John Packington and Mr. Bromley carried it
gloriously against Mr. Walsh, who was set up by the Dissenters. Sir
John Packington had a banner carried before him, whereon was
painted <i>a church falling,</i> with this inscription&mdash;‘<i>For the Queen and
Church, Packington.</i>’ It was observable, that while they were marching
through the Foregate-Street, they met the Bishop’s coach, in
which was a <i>Non-Con. teacher</i>, going to poll for Capt. Walsh, but the
horses (at the sight of the church, as ’twas believed) turned tail, overturned
and broke the same, and very much bruised the <i>Holder-Forth’s</i>
outward man; and this raised no small admiration that the Bishop’s
horses should be afraid of a church.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The commotion which in the days of Queen Anne was
manifested in the public thoroughfares at an electioneering
epoch is incidentally pictured by Dean Swift, in his “Journal
to Stella:”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Oct. 5, 1710.&mdash;This morning Delaval came to see me, and went
to Kneller’s, who was in town. On the way we met the electors for
parliament-men, and the rabble came about our coach, crying, ‘A
Colt! A Stanhope! etc.’ <i>We were afraid of a dead cat, or our glasses
broken, and so were always of their side.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the lost illustrations of the humours of elections
is the ballad, “full of puns,” which Swift mentions
having produced on that said Westminster election; for
any trace of which we have vainly searched among the
political pamphlets and poetical broadsides of the Queen
Anne era.</p>

<p>It is Swift who relates the untoward catastrophe which
awaited his friend, Richard Steele, the improvident
“Tatler,” who, having a design to serve in the last
parliament of Queen Anne, resigned his place of Commissioner
of the Stamp Office in June, 1713, and was chosen
for the borough of Stockbridge, in Hampshire, one of the
snug constituencies swept away by the Reform Bill a
century or so later. The Dean writes of Dick’s adventures
on this errand:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There was nothing there to perplex him but the payment of a
&pound;300 bond, which lessened the sum he carried down, and which an
odd dog of a creditor had intimation of and took this opportunity to
recover.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Steele’s parliamentary career was brief. He had not
been long in the House before he contrived to get expelled,
and gave deadly offence to the queen, by writing “The
Englishman” and “The Crisis” against the Jacobite Tories.
With the advent of his “Protestant hero,” George I.,
Steele secured patronage, knighthood, and a seat in the
first parliament, where he sat for the since-notorious
Boroughbridge, Yorkshire.</p>

<p>A deeply designed stroke of electioneering policy is
credited to Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who excelled
in the subtle tactics invaluable in these emergencies, which
raised her to the level of Wharton in election fame, while
promoting the success of her nominees. Lord Grimston
happened to oppose her grace’s candidates. Now, Lord
Grimston, as is related by Johnson, had written a heavy
play, “Love in a Hollow Tree,” having become ashamed
of which bantling, he did his best to suppress it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The leaden crown devolved on thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great poet of the hollow tree.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“But the Duchess of Marlborough had kept one, and when he was
against her at an election, she had a new edition of it printed, and
prefixed to it, as a frontispiece, an elephant dancing on a rope; to
show that his Lordship’s writing comedy was as awkward as an elephant
dancing on a rope.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was so much a matter of course that everything
in a man’s life should tell against him, if he had the
temerity to stand for parliament, that Johnson, when
interrogated by Boswell, “whether a certain act of folly
would injure a friend of theirs for life?” replied, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>“It may

perhaps, sir, be mentioned at an election,”&mdash;the duchess’s
feat probably presenting itself to Johnson’s mind at the
time.</p>

<p>Hannay, in his sparkling essay on “Electioneering,”
also relates the following:&mdash;“Mamma,” said a young
candidate to his parent in deep confidence, one nomination
day, “tell me truly, is there anything against my birth?”&mdash;an
ingenious precaution in view of eventualities which the
youth not imprudently employed to prepare himself for
the worst, and that he might not he taken by surprise at
the hustings.</p>

<p>The Tories were forced, after their failure to proclaim
the Pretender as successor to Queen Anne, to subscribe
their loyalty on the accession of George I. This they did
with a reservation, as hinted by their opponents, who now
held the good things of the administration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Your fathers, like men, who had thoughts of a Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took the Oaths in the Sense in which they were given;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you, like your Brethren the Jesuits, can find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A way to evade all the ties of mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that nothing but Halters your faction can bind.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was not without reasonable suspicions of the Jacobite
party that the ministers of George I. deemed it prudent
to keep the Commons they had, rather than face a fresh
election, since a general mistrust was abroad. From an
effusion upon the bell-ringing in 1716, on the anniversary
of Queen Anne’s coronation, it appears this tribute of
respect to the memory of the late sovereign was regarded
as a Tory manifesto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis Nancy’s Coronation Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whom ye hop’d to bring in play<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Young George, the Chevalier.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Fate, who best disposes things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulls down Queens and sets up Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A better George sent here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>According to the lyrist, the papists were tired of
praying for Walpole’s abrupt end; but the conclusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
exhibits the feeling then prevailing&mdash;and which was
justified by after-events,&mdash;that the prolonged sessions of
parliament under the new Septennial Act offered some
defence against the schemes of their opponents; in fact,
the tables were turned, and the Whigs of this parliament
dreaded the machinations of the Tories, much as the
Abhorrers and courtiers detested and feared the Whigs
under Charles II.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>The Pretender, whose cause looked hopeful at the time
of his “dear sister’s” decease, was treated by the Whig
satirists with all the ridicule their pens could command:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whatever prospects the Pretender and his good friends
the Tories might have cherished on the accession of George
I., were abruptly put to flight after the abortive rising in

utter failure, are wittily set forth in the ballad:&mdash;</p>

<h3>“THE RIGHT AND TRUE HISTORY OF PERKIN.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ye <i>Whigs</i>, and eke you <i>Tories</i>, give ear to what I sing;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Depending on this pious crew of ‘Non-Resisting’ Saints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thought by plund’ring of the Whigs to make up all their wants.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to begin the show,&mdash;Lord Mar,&mdash;that never was upright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To summon all his Bag-pipe-men, to Scotland took his flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></span>
<span class="i0">He sent his <i>baillie</i> Jockey round to summon all his clans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a concert of Bag-pipes&mdash;it should been <i>Warming-pans</i>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told ’em they might all for mighty Honours look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he that was before a Lord, was now become a Duke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all (he said) should great men be, which was the way to win ’em.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he got an army of captains all, and scarce a soldier in ’em.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finding of his numbers great, he sent a brigadier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To join a band of Fox-Hunters, that were near Lancashire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These march’d into Preston town, the women for to frighten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they show’d their talent lay, in marching, not in fighting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They challeng’d Gen’ral Carpenter to run with them a race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And troth they beat him out and out, he could not keep ’em pace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Wills with expeditious march these foot-pads did surround,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then they look’d like harmless sheep coop’d up within a pound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Forster got a posset, and gave his priest the Tythe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But posset could not make the priest nor general look blithe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Forster and his perjur’d crew surrender prisoners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show’d they were no Whigs, for they did not delight in wars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then as they march’d to London, Oh! ’twas a gallant show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Whigs bid the music play ‘<i>Traitors all a-row</i>.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About this time the said Lord Mar (depending on his number)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">March’d up against the brave Argyle, and thought to bring him under.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tho’ he had full four to one (which you may say is odds)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Highland Loons dress’d dreadfully, with Bonnets, Dirks, and plads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet bold Argyle, with Britons brave, engag’d him near Dunblane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon with loss made him retire much faster than he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Mar sent to the Chevalier, to hasten o’er to Scoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, ‘He should not want a crown, tho’ the Ale-wives pawn’d their spoon.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Mar’s design was plainly, when next they went to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to show a <i>dismal thing</i> which would like Death’s-head fright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the <i>pale-fac’d Hero</i> came, and like an Owler lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed he had much reason, for the goods were contrabands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soon as he arrived, a Scottish ague took him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho’ he swallow’d <i>Jesuit’s Bark</i>, Good Lady! how it shook him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The non-resisting Damsels believ’d the omen bad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When at first speech the <i>Baby</i> cried, which made his Council mad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he heard Argyle approach’d with army in array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Perkin came in like a thief, so again he stole away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there’s an end of Perkin, and thus I end my Lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With God preserve our Glorious George, and all his royal race!”<br /></span>

<span class="medium">ELECTIONEERING AND PARTY TACTICS UNDER GEORGE I. AND II.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">A fair representation of a chairing scene is given as the
second of a series of eight plates which, under the title of
“Robin’s Progress,” satirically delineates the career of
Sir Robert Walpole. The newly elected member is seated,
tranquilly enough, in a capacious arm-chair, raised aloft
by his supporters; there are a few “bludgeon-men”
among his followers. Hats are thrown into the air, and
a general sense of satisfaction is shown to prevail. One
of the party, evidently a person of influence, is made to
exclaim, “No bribery, no corruption!” A group of more
distrustful persons is pictured in the foreground; an elector
observes, “I wish we mayn’t be deceived,” while his confederate
is declaring, “I smell a rat!” Whatever “undue
influence” might have been hinted on this occasion,
Walpole had not at that early date (1701) developed the
arts of corruption and electioneering, then synonymous; his
proficiency in these branches was of later growth. Although
not strictly a contemporaneous picture of the event, the
engraving which represents the chairing of Sir Robert
Walpole on his election for Castle Rising, Norfolk, in 1701,
is the earliest of our election illustrations as regards the
date of the incident depicted. Walpole, in succession to his
father, sat for Castle Rising, in the last two short parliaments
which preceded the death of William III., and at once
distinguished himself as an active and able ally of the Whig
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
party, then holding the power of administration. In 1702,
he was chosen member for King’s Lynn, and represented
that borough in several successive parliaments. After, with
the interest of George, Prince of Denmark, filling the posts
of secretary at war, 1708, and treasurer of the navy, 1709,
the Tory advisers of the latter part of Queen Anne’s reign
dismissed Walpole from all his posts. The Commons in
1711 voting him guilty of a high breach of trust and
notorious corruption in his office as secretary at war, it
was resolved to expel him from the House, and that he
should be committed to the Tower. Under this vindictive
persecution, he was, by his party, regarded as a martyr
to the cause, nor does there appear sufficient proof to justify
this severity. Encouraged by Walpole’s energetic tactics,
his constituents remained firm, and he was re-elected by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the burgesses of Lynn in 1713-14, and, though the House
declared the return void, yet the electors persisted in their
choice, and Walpole took a decided part against the
queen’s Tory ministry, until “the turn of the wheel,”
which raised the Elector of Hanover on the English throne
as Queen Anne’s successor, threw back the power of
administration into the hands of Walpole and the Whigs,
and once more reduced the Tories to vent their mortification
in unscrupulous attacks and misrepresentations, while they
were themselves exerting all their abilities for the subversion
of the House of Hanover and the restoration of the exiled
Stuarts. The bitterness of party warfare was mostly manifested
at election times. A burlesque “Bill of Costs” was
printed in the <i>Flying Post</i> (Jan. 27, 1715), “for a late
Tory election in the West,” in which part of the country
the Tory interest was strongest:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be observed in this “bill” that bribery is not
put down as one of the prominent features of an election
at this period; violence was, as yet, found to be more
effective than corruption.</p>

<p>In March, 1721, when the first of the succession of
triennial parliaments dissolved, the country was already
in a state of fermentation at the prospect of the coming
contest. Violence was now utilized in new methods, such
as beating off voters of opposition candidates; while hostile
electors were surrounded by mobs hired for the purpose,
and cut off from the polling-booths; and in some cases
voters were carried off forcibly, and locked up until the
election was over.</p>

<p>In country boroughs much agitation was manifested,
and in several places, such as Coventry, formidable riots
took place.</p>

<p>The metropolis shared the general excitement. It was
on this occasion that the Westminster contest began to be
regarded as of the first consequence, it being a point of
ambition with the rival parties to return their candidates
for this constituency, the results of which conflict were
expected to exercise an influence upon other places. The
election for this city set in uproariously in 1721, and, as
the progress of these electioneering memorials will demonstrate,
it continued the same throughout its history, even
when in other places the elections were tranquil and uneventful.</p>

<p>The Tories did not allow Walpole to triumph without
a struggle for the ascendency, although, by his foresight,
and a lavish employment of his universal salve&mdash;gold, he
managed to diminish the influence both of his opponents
and of the mobocracy; and in the new House the Government
secured a powerful majority, leaving the Tory organs,
towards the close of the elections, when the results were
no longer doubtful, to vent their spleen in political squibs
and caricatures. Thus, on the 31st of March, the <i>Post
Boy</i> announces two satirical prints&mdash;one, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>“Britannia

stript by a Villain, to which is added, the True Phiz of a
Late Member,” which seems to have disappeared completely;
and the other, “The Prevailing Candidate; or
the Election carried by Bribery and the D&mdash;&mdash;l;” which,
according to all accounts, is the earliest existing contemporary
caricature upon the subject of electioneering; and
is, moreover, one of the best examples of these productions
as published in the reign of George I.</p>

THE D&mdash;&mdash;L.</span><br />(Dr. Newton’s Collection.)</p>
</div>

<p>The candidate, it is implied, is a Court nominee; the
screen is used to conceal the true movers of the wires, who
are at the back of the canvasser; their reflection is shown
in the mirror behind, above the console-table, on which
bags of money are in readiness to be used for bribery.
The wooden shoes symbolize a threatened relapse to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
slavery. The screen is to typify the seven years of the last
parliament&mdash;the first of the septennial parliaments; the
year 1716 is marked “Septennial Act”&mdash;“Part of the
Succession Act repealed;”&mdash;1720 registers the “South
Sea Act,”&mdash;“Act to indemnify South Sea Villains;” and
1721 the “Quarantine Act, <i>cum multis aliis</i>;” the other
years are blanks. The accompanying verses explain the
meaning intended to be conveyed by the principal figures.
The personage bribed is the mayor of the place. These
functionaries for a long time held the elections in their
power, and were amenable to corrupt treatment; in fact,
they were expected to make the bargain most advantageous
for the court of livery or aldermen, in whom the votes were
generally vested. Hence the old saying, “Money makes
the mayor to go.”</p>

<p>The elections of 1727, in spite of the exertions of Bolingbroke
and Pulteney in the <i>Craftsman</i>, and the intrigues of the
former with the Duchess of Kendal, mistress of George I.,
were a disappointment to the Tories and “patriots,” <i>i.e.</i>
Jacobites. On the death of George I. their prospects
were even less promising. Queen Caroline, the consort of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
George II., was the steadfast friend of Walpole, and although
the Bolingbroke faction paid their court to the mistress of
the new king, as they had done in the last reign to that
of his predecessor, they gained nothing by their motion,
as George II. was governed by his wife in political questions.
The hopes placed by the Tories in the elections were altogether
frustrated; in the parliament chosen in 1727 the
ministerial majority was greater than before, and their
opponents were reduced to vent their mortification in
strictures against the bribery, corruption, undue influence,
and those secret intrigues in which they were themselves
such adepts.</p>

<p>Of the few caricatures to which this contest gave rise
that best known is entitled “Ready Money the Prevailing
Candidate; or the Humours of an Election;” and even in
this the satirical allusions appear to have a general rather
than a specific application. This picture, like most of the
caricatures of the time, is slightly allegorical; the scene
is evidently the outskirts of a town; colossal statues of
“Folly” and “Justice” are shown at either side. As the
title implies, bribery is the motive power of the entire
action. In the centre is a figure with his back to the
spectator; the rear of this person’s coat is covered with
pockets, into which those interested in the work of buying
votes are dropping money; the recipient is declaring, “No
bribery, but pockets are free.” Another gentleman, with
his hat raised in the air, is crying, “Sell not your country.”
A whole body of electors behind these plausible individuals
are standing ready to be bought; an agent is canvassing
this group for their votes, with a money-bag to meet their
requirements. To the right, a man is kneeling to secure a
heap of pieces, which are lavishly scattered about, while
another person is stooping to press a well-filled bag of
money upon his acceptance as “a small acknowledgment.”
One of the candidates, handsomely attired, and with a
feathered hat, is carried on a litter by four bearers, much
like “Chairing a member;” he has bags of money in both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
hands, and his progress is marked by a shower of gold
“for his country’s service.” At the door of an inn stands
a figure whose head is supplemented with antlers&mdash;“He
kissed my wife, he shall have my vote!” “Folly” is
personated by a male effigy, also emptying out money-bags
to his votaries: before his altar a candidate is kneeling
amidst his canvassing tickets; he is exclaiming, “Help me,
Folly, or my cause is lost.” In the foreground is the
figure of an ancient philosopher, who is made to say, “Let
not thy right hand know what thy left does;” his left hand
is accommodatingly held behind his back, and this an
agent is filling with pieces. A person dressed like a Covenanter
is crying, “See here, see here!” The emblematical
figure of “Justice,” blind, and with her attributes of sword
and scales, has her altar deserted. One man is admonishing
his neighbour to “Regard Justice;” the other, who
has a sack of unlawful treasure on his shoulder, replies,
“We fell out: I lost money by her.” A modishly dressed
candidate, hat in hand, is pressing a bag of money on
another individual, who seems to have been bribed already,
but is willing to accept further emoluments&mdash;“’Twill scarce
pay, make it twenty more.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE KENTISH ELECTION, 1734.</p>
</div>

<p>A realistic version of the hustings appeared under the
title of “The Kentish Election, 1734.” The locality of the
gathering here represented is probably Maidstone in Kent.
A large open space on the outskirts of the town is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
scene of action. The candidates and their numerous
supporters are raised above the multitude, and standing on
the hustings. Round this erection is a great crowd of
electors, many of whom are on horseback.</p>

<p>In the foreground, a mounted clergyman is at the head
of a procession of his flock, all wearing favours in their
hats, and professing themselves supporters of the “Protestant
Interest,” <i>i.e.</i> Whigs; two of them carry staves and
books; the “gauges” in their hands seem to indicate
that they are gaugers or excisemen, <i>i.e.</i> placemen: it must
be noted that the chief grievance against Walpole and his
administration at this time was the attempt to tax tobacco
and wines. The Opposition party-cry is “No Excise,”
with the names of “Vane and Dering,” the successful
candidates, in whose honour, with that of the “Country
Interest,” <i>i.e.</i> Tories, which they had pledged themselves
to promote, the followers of their party wear sprigs of
oak in their hats&mdash;a memorial of the Restoration of the
Stuarts. The party-cry of their antagonists is for “King
and Country,” and “Middlesex and Oxenden.” Sir George
Oxenden had voted for the Government and in favour of
the Excise Bill; he sat for Maidstone before the dissolution,
April, 1734. The Earl of Middlesex was not a member of
the former Parliament. These gentlemen finally threw up
the poll, the victory of their opponents being assured,
May 16, 1734. Of the successful candidates, Viscount
Vane and Sir Edward Dering, the former had voted
against the Excise Bill, and the latter was absent on the
division. Something in the way of influencing suffrages
seems to have been done on a large scale by Viscount
Vane. Two hogsheads of French brandy were sent down
to his seat in Kent (according to the <i>Daily Post</i>), together
with sixty dozen of knives and forks, in preparation for the
entertainment his lordship offered the freeholders. <i>The
Grub Street Journal</i> devotes some attention to the treats
with which the successful candidates regaled their constituents
at an early stage of their canvass, and these
hospitalities were returned in kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>“At a meeting lately at the <i>Swan Tavern</i> in Cornhill,
of about 100 substantial worthy citizens of London, freeholders
of the County of Kent, the Right Hon. the Lord
Vane and Sir Edw. Dering, Bart., candidates in the Country
Interest, were entertained in an elegant manner by the
freeholders,” etc. It is further stated that “these candidates
were met at about two miles from Westerham, in
Kent, by 300 freeholders on horseback, and dined at the
<i>George Inn</i>, where healths were drunk to the glorious 205”&mdash;this
being the number of members whose votes placed
the Government in a minority upon the Excise Bill. Nor
was wanting what later statesmen have termed “the
fine old English Institution” of parading the Minister in
effigy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The populace, to show their zeal on this occasion, dressed up a
figure of a certain Excise gentleman (Sir Robert Walpole to wit) with
blue paper round his shoulders (intended for the riband of the Garter,
always alluded to with spite by the prime minister’s adversaries), a
pipe in his mouth (Tobacco Bill), and several Florence flasks about
his neck (referring to the proposed duty on wines), then mounted him
upon a mule, and led him round the town in procession.” (<i>The Grub
Street Journal.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same authority (No. 230), under date Wednesday,
May 23, 1734, is announced the sudden demise of the leading
candidate: “On Monday, about five in the afternoon,
the Right Hon. the Lord Visc. Vane dropt down dead of an
apoplexy, just as he was taking leave of a gentleman, at
his seat at Fairlawn in Kent” (<i>Daily Post</i>).</p>

<p>An early design upon bribery at elections is attributed
to Hogarth. This plate was produced during the canvass
in 1734, just twenty years before the commencement of the
famous “Election” series by the same artist. The print
is a small etching, and represents Sir Robert Fagg, an old
baronet, seated on horseback, holding a purse in one hand,
and offering a bribe of money to a young woman who is
standing by his horse’s head; on her arm is a basket of
eggs; she is laughing at the canvasser. Sir Robert Fagg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
was member for Steyning, Sussex. Concerning the baronet
it is written, in “The Art of Politicks”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Leave you of mighty Interest to brag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poll two voices like <i>Sir Robert Fagg</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“The Humours of a Country Election,” of which the
first version appeared in 1734, beyond the light it offers
upon the subject in question, is curious and interesting, as
Mr. F. G. Stephens is inclined to suggest<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> that Hogarth
may have borrowed the idea of illustrating the chief
incidents of an election from the “Humours” therein
described. The plate is in three divisions, and forms the
frontispiece to the collection of songs published under the
title of “the Humours of a Country Election” in 1734, at
which time there was a general election; it was republished
in 1741,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> under similar circumstances. The print is sufficiently
described by the original advertisement, inserted at
the time of its publication in the <i>Grub Street Journal</i>
(No. 233), June 13, 1734. “<i>This Day is publish’d</i> (Price
One Shilling), Neatly printed, and <i>stitched in blue paper</i>,
‘The Humours of a Country Election.’”</p>

the following particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I. The candidate welcomed into the town by music and
electors on horseback, attended by a mob of men, women,
and children. The candidates saluting the women, and
amongst them a poor cobbler’s wife, to whose child they
very courteously offer to stand God-father. II. The candidates
are very complaisant to a country clown, and offering
presents (a bag marked 50<i>l.</i>) to the wife and children.
The candidates making an entertainment for the electors
and their wives, to whom they show great respect; at the
upper end of the table the parson of the parish sitting, his
clerk standing by him. III. The place of electing and
polling, with mob attending. The members elect carried
in procession in chairs, upon men’s shoulders, with music
playing before them; attended by a mob of men, women,
and children huzzaing them. To which is added the
character of a Trimmer in verse, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>“A new Year’s Gift (for the year 1741) to the Electors of
Great Britain,” contains the information that “The Oath
imposed upon Electors&mdash;the only preservative of public
Liberty from the secret and fatal attacks of Bribery and
Corruption,” was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘I, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, do swear, I have not received, or had myself, or
any person whatsoever, in Trust for me, or for my Use and Benefit,
directly or indirectly, any sum or sums of money, Office, Place, or
employment, gift, or reward, or any promise, or security for any
money, office, employment, or gift, in order to give my vote at this
Election, and that I have not been polled before at this Election,</p>

<p class="author">‘So Help me God.’</p>

<p>“Let every man of common sense judge whether an oath so
wisely framed and strictly worded can possibly admit of any equivocation,
to cover the base villainy of taking a bribe to his country’s ruin;
and what shall we think of those men who dare tempt others to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
breach of a duty so sacred! Ought they not to be stoned, or hooted
out of society, as the destroyers of public Faith, Virtue, Religion, and
Liberty? Do not such agents for the Devil compass his ends most
effectually, by seducing men from the indispensable duties they owe to
God and their country, to themselves and their posterity?</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 90.</i></p>
</div>

<p>“Wisely, therefore, hath that good Law annexed the shameful
penalties of the pillory to the breach of that Sacred Oath, with a large
Fine of Five Hundred Pounds; and justly excluded all base perjurers
from the most valuable Rights and Privileges of <i>Englishmen</i>, in the
following paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘And be it enacted, That whosoever shall be convicted of false
swearing, shall incur and suffer the Pains and Penalties as in a case
of wilful and corrupt Perjury.</p>

<p>“And whosoever shall receive or take any money or other reward,
by way of Gift, Loan, or other device, or agree or contract for any
Money, Gift, Office, or Reward whatsoever, to give his vote, shall for
every such offence forfeit the sum of Five Hundred Pounds, and be
<i>for ever</i> disabled to vote in any Election of any Member to Parliament,
and be for ever disabled to hold any public office.’</p>

<p>“Will any man, pretending to common honesty, thus basely forfeit
his Birthright, his most glorious privilege as an Englishman, by a
shameful perjury for the Lucre of a Bribe? Can such a Bribe make
him and his posterity happy in the midst of his country’s ruin, and
the just contempt and abhorrence of all his neighbours? No, surely:
but when the small wages of his iniquity are spent, he must, like the
Traitor Judas, hang himself, or starve to death; because no man can
either pity, or deal with such a perjured abandoned wretch.</p>

<p>“Artful corruptors of the present times may flatter weak minds
with hopes of being admitted to vote without taking the Oath; but it
is a vain delusion; since the Law allows the <i>Candidates or any two of
the Electors</i> to put the Oath to whomsoever they please; and surely
there are at least <i>Two Honest Men</i> in every Borough of the Kingdom,
who will think it their duty to bring Corruption to the Test of this
just and necessary Oath, to the eternal infamy of all Corruptors, and
the Corrupted.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The oath thus explicitly explained was in sober earnest
administered by the lawyers retained in the respective
interests, as illustrated by Hogarth in his “Polling
Booth,” 1754. It is rather alarming to think of the huge
amount of perjury which has followed electioneering.
The general elections of the spring of 1741 were a trying
ordeal for Walpole; all the well-worn clamours were
revived, the “Convention” was once more torn to shreds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and fresh attacks upon the “excise projects” were turned
to bitter political account. Amidst a shower of squibs,
both literary and pictorial, we find the caricature, “Dedicated
to the worthy Electors of Great Britain,” of “The
Devil upon Two Sticks,” in
which Walpole, as the “Asmodeus”
of the situation, is represented
as being supported upon
the shoulders of two of his
bought-majority to ford the
“Slough of Despond,” already
crossed by some of his followers,
who, though in safety on the
bank, bear evident marks of
the dirty ordeal through which
they have been compelled to
struggle upon “Robin’s” account.
Britannia and her patriotic
friends(?) remain high and
dry on the other shore; below
the satire appears a pointed
indication of the unpopular
Walpolians, as “Members who voted for the Excise and
against the Convention.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE DEVIL ON TWO STICKS. 1741.</p>
</div>

<p>“A Satire on Election Proceedings” was given to the
public in pictorial guise on the occasion of the appeal to
the constituencies in May, 1741; the specific part of this
squib was aimed at Walpole’s unpopular taxes and similar
enactments, and the whole was dedicated to “Mayors and
Corporations in general.” A dying elector&mdash;who, from the
evidence of a paper inscribed “&pound;50,” and seen in his pocket,
has sold himself to party&mdash;is in the hands of a ministerial
candidate and the personage of Evil; who are, between
them, dragging the moribund and venal voter towards a
precipice, “the Brink of Despotism, poverty, and destruction,
inevitable if such courses are continued.” The
candidate or agent is apparently heedless of the precipice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
at his feet; he is waving his hat in exultation, and
shouting, “A vote, a vote, a dead vote for us!” The
devil, who is the deepest of the party, is asserting with
plausibility, “I’ll have the Majority, I warrant you!”
His pocket contains the measures which had destroyed
Walpole’s popularity and at that time foreshadowed his fall&mdash;fancifully
supposed to have had their suggestion in the
brain of the arch-fiend himself: “Standing Army,”
“Lotteries,” “Cyder” (tax), “Stamp Act,” “Bribes,”
and “Address.” The demon is expelling “False reports
against the City of London&mdash;all wind”&mdash;patriotism having
at that era its head-quarters in the corporation; his hoof has
trampled upon the shield of Britannia, crushed down by
“Press-warrants,” “Council of Satan,” and the ministerial
policy&mdash;“Neglect the seamen till the moment they are
wanted, lest my beloved press-warrants should be forgot&mdash;my
friends shall boldly call them lawful.” Walpole, whose
tenure of office notoriously depended on the results of the
elections in progress when this violent squib was launched,
is further indicated in “The Foundation <i>we</i> go upon;”
“<i>we</i>” being by implication the prime minister and the
devil; the foot of the latter rests upon these “Ways and
means&mdash;Public Money, Promises, Titles, Contracts, Pensions,
Preferments, Places&mdash;and by threatening to displace,”
etc., besides current coin for corruption. A further
instance of Walpole’s disfavour is embodied in a paper
concerning the army: “My Majority shall vote for a
numerous Land Force in time of Peace; to be established
with a double proportion of officers!&mdash;the best proof of my
influence:”&mdash;the source of that vaunted influence is shown
in a bag of money, marked “Sinking Fund,” from whence
pours the stream of corruption&mdash;in the shape of broad
pieces&mdash;upon which the prime minister placed a reliance
he did not attempt to disguise, but, on the contrary, of
which he cynically boasted.</p>

<p>Beneath is a coat of arms, a favourite figure with the
satirists, as if designed for the sign of a tavern; the bearings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
are, 1. A fox running away with a goose. 2.
“Checquy,” <i>i.e.</i>, as in the sign of the Chequers; the words,
“Time-servers Intire;” behind appear a bottle and two
glasses, tobacco-pipes, and bribes. “&pound;100, &pound;50, &pound;40,
&pound;2,”&mdash;to suit all appetites; on a riband above the shield
is the legend:&mdash;“Votes are sold for Wine and Gold.” The
crest of the card would be a suitable escutcheon for
Hogarth’s comprehensive election satires which appeared
in the contest of 1754.</p>

<p>Another coat of arms, also aimed at the credit of the
prime minister, was reissued as appropriate to this
season:&mdash;“To the glory of the Rt. Honble. Sir Robert
Walpole,” “A great Britt.,” alluding to the motto of “S(ir)
R(obert) W(alpole)’s Arms,” supplies an ironical and explanatory
text:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is another Device at the Base, the <i>Arch</i>, in the shape of a
<i>Coat of Arms</i>, which is bound round with a <i>Garter</i>, and hath these
words inscribed upon it:&mdash;<i>Honi soit qui Mal y pense</i>; ‘Evil be to him,
that evil thinks.’ What is most remarkable in this <i>Coat</i> is, that it
bears <i>three axes</i> on one side, and that the crest is a <i>Man’s Head</i>, with
a strange sort of <i>Cap</i>, which hath a Ducal Coronet at the bottom by
way of Border;”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;thus suggesting that Walpole deserved decapitation,
while the ballads of the day were all for finding a gibbet
for “false Bob.” As to the print itself, it is said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am glad to hear that it hath already met with the approbation
and encouragement of a <i>very great Family</i>; and I hope shortly to see
it displayed in the richest colours upon Fans, and wrought into <i>Screens</i>
and <i>Hangings</i> for the use and ornament of the Palace of Norfolk;”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;referring to Houghton Hall, the seat of Sir Robert
Walpole, a residence well known to fame.</p>

<p>The popular interest excited by the Westminster contest
generally seemed to make that election the most prominent
in every appeal to the country. On the dissolution of
parliament, April 28, 1741, when the fate of Walpole’s
Administration was known to depend upon the aggregate
return of his nominees, the ministers expected to bring in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
their friends who had previously sat for Westminster; the
first great opposition to the Government had its rise there,
where the Court was supposed to possess an unbounded
influence. In the “Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole” the
circumstances of the contest are thus summarized:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The representatives in the last Parliament were Sir Charles
Wager, First Lord of the Admiralty; and Lord Sundon, a Lord of the
Treasury; and it was supposed they would have been rechosen, as
usual, without opposition. But Lord Sundon was very unpopular;
he had been raised from a low condition to an Irish Peerage through
the interest of his wife, who had been favourite bed-chamber woman
to Queen Catherine, wife of George II. The other candidate, Sir
Charles Wager, was unexceptionable, both in his public and private
character; but his attachment to the Minister was a sufficient objection.
Some electors of Westminster proposed, very unexpectedly,
Admiral Vernon, then in the height of his popularity, and Charles
Edwin, a private gentleman of considerable fortune. The opposition,
at first despised, became formidable; and Sir Charles Wager being summoned
to convoy the King to Holland, the management of the election
was entrusted to ignorant vestrymen and violent justices. The
majority of the electors were decidedly in favour of the Ministerial
candidate; but Lord Sundon was imprudently advised to close the
poll, to order a party of Guards to attend, and, while the military
power surrounded the hustings, the High Bailiff returned him and Sir
Charles Wager. This imprudent conduct highly exasperated the
populace, the Guards were insulted, Sundon was attacked, and
narrowly escaped with life. The example of the opposition at Westminster
diffused a general spirit throughout the kingdom, and violent
contests were excited in all quarters. Large sums of money for
supporting the expenses were subscribed by Pulteney, the Duchess
of Marlborough, and the Prince of Wales, who contracted great debts
on this memorable occasion, and the managers of the opposition
employed this money with great advantage.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This account, by W. Coxe, epitomizes the situation.
George (Bubb) Dodington was active on this occasion,
directing the manœuvres of the Leicester House faction, on
behalf of the heir to the throne, in opposition to the
ministers of his father, the king. Naturally the view
taken by Walpole’s biographer is favourable to that
minister, who was at this time looked upon as the under-hand
enemy of his country. He was accused of favouring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Spain and France; and the taking of Porto Bello by Admiral
Vernon, which was not, after all, a brilliant affair, but
chiefly due to the cowardice of its defenders, was regarded
as quite as much of a victory over the prime minister as
over England’s foes. These sentiments characterize the
spirit abroad on the Westminster contest of 1741, which
gave rise to many songs, broadsides, and pictorial satires
uniformly unfavourable to the minister and his adherents.</p>

<p>The kind of influence or coercion brought to bear is
described in an “Address to the Independent and Worthy
Electors,” which was issued by the “patriotic party,” May
5th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Notwithstanding the extraordinary methods used by some of the
Burgesses of the Westminster Court, the select vestries of several of
the parishes, and the High Constable; who has in his own name, and
by his own power, taken upon him to summon the inhabitants to give
their Poll <i>against</i> Admiral Vernon and Mr. Edwin; we have been
already so successful in our endeavours to retrieve the <i>independency</i>
of this City and Liberty, in the Election for the next Parliament, that
the old members have but a very inconsiderable majority (if any) of
Good Votes against</p>

<div class="table">
<span class="trow tdc">The Glorious <span class="smcap">Admiral Vernon</span>,</span>
<span class="trow tdc">And <span class="smcap">Charles Edwin</span>, Esq.,</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">who stand upon the Country Interest.</p>

<p>Therefore, Gentlemen, now is the time for completing what we have
so successfully begun; since it is certain that almost the <i>whole</i> of the
Interest on the other side is already near poll’d, and not one-fourth of
ours. And considering the great and perhaps decisive turn that the
Election of this City and Liberty may give to the Elections all over the
kingdom, it is hoped that no man who has a regard for the Liberties
of his Country, and the Independency of Parliament, will lie by or
remain neuter upon this occasion.</p>

<p>Therefore your Votes and Interest in favour of</p>

<div class="table">
<span class="trow tdc"><span class="smcap">Admiral Vernon</span>, and</span>
<span class="trow tdc"><span class="smcap">Charles Edwin</span>, Esq.,</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">who have no other views than the good of their country and the
prosperity of this ancient City and Liberty.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The contest thus stood: the king, Duke of Cumberland,
and the ministers,&mdash;with all their patronage, but
overburdened with unpopularity, especially as regarded certain
acts touching the navy, the standing army, and excise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
and other new taxes disliked by most,&mdash;supporting candidates
looked upon with disfavour, on the one side; opposed by the
Prince of Wales and his active friends of the “patriotic
party,” with a popular naval commander and “a friend of
his country” as candidates, and the voice of the multitude,
on the other; the arena being the hustings at Covent
Garden, supposed to be regarded expectantly by all the
constituencies in the country.</p>

<p class="caption">TO THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF WESTMINSTER. VERNON AND EDWIN. 1741.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 97.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A pictorial version of the scene of the Westminster
Election, 1741, dedicated “to the brave Admiral Vernon
and his worthy colleague, Charles Edwin, Esq.,” appeared
with a copy of verses “To the Independent and Worthy
Electors of this Ancient City of Westminster.” The candidates
are exhibited before the front of Covent Garden
Church; in the pediment is shown a dial, with the motto
which at that time caught the eye of the moving crowd,
“So Passes Ye Glory of Ye World.” Seated at a table
in the portico beneath, are the poll clerks, with the
returning officer casting up the votes: one clerk is directing
a list to be set down in the “Poll Book” for “Vernon
and Edwin;” while the representative of the other side
says, “Few for my Lord.” Vernon’s ships, and the benefit
of increased commerce in the shape of bales of merchandise,
are shown in the distance; the favoured admiral himself,
with laced cocked hat and a staff in his right hand, is
declaring, “For the Glory of Britain, down with the
Spaniards.” In front of the platform, and next the popular
favourite, stands Charles Edwin, who is declaring his
sentiments to be for “My King and my Country.” The
candidates of the opposition are received with enthusiasm:
“Vernon for ever, no dribbers here;” “Edwin at
home, Vernon abroad,” is shouted by the persons to the
left of the picture. The results of the election were
undetermined when this engraving appeared, so the engraver
has anticipated the ultimate results of the petition,
and made the ministerial candidates unsuccessful. Sir
Charles Wager, in a dejected state, is exclaiming, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>“I don’t

know where to put up next.” Lord Sundon, represented
as a mere “fribble,” is in conference with Justice De Veil,
who had a large share in the control of the Westminster
election, and being in the Government pay and a powerful
partisan, was, together with the returning officer, on these
accounts the object of popular indignation. Lord Sundon
is declaring for “The Excise and another place:” the
duties on “cyder” and fermented liquors gave extreme
offence to the multitude. The magistrate is made to exclaim,
“I, Justice De Veil, say so, and will justify it.” The good
folks on the right are hissing, and crying, “No pensioners!”
A female is pronouncing for the gallant admiral, “Vernon
among the women to a man;” and a voter is denouncing
“Spithead Lights,”&mdash;in reference to the reviews and home
displays of the Admiralty, represented by Sir Charles
Wager.</p>

<p>Below the design are the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And such they are make happy states.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Towards the close, the state of the poll stood thus:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sir Charles Wager, 3686.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lord Sundon, 3533.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Admiral Vernon, 3290.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Charles Edwin, 3161.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings, when the independent
candidates claimed to have many votes in reserve, while
the ministers had exhausted every subterfuge and all their
resources, Lord Sundon very injudiciously appealed to an
armed intervention, forcibly closed the poll, and ordered a
body of grenadiers to surround the hustings, and prevent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
any further voting; while the high bailiff countenanced these
high-handed illegalities, and made his return accordingly.
This proceeding ruined the chances of the Government in
this contest of 1741: a petition was presented against
the return of Wager and Sundon, and, although Walpole
fought with all his influence, the subject was made a party
question; in the new session, a warm contest arose in the
Commons, which reassembled June 25, 1741, and the
return of the sitting members was decided against by a
majority of four, the numbers told being 220 to 216.
The circumstance of “the election being declared void,” is
alluded to in a letter from Horace Walpole to Sir H. Mann,
December 10, 1741: “Mr. Pulteney presented an immense
piece of parchment, which he said he could but just lift;
and was the Westminster Petition, and is to be heard next
Tuesday, when we shall all have our brains knocked out
by the mob.” A new election ensued; Charles Edwin and
Lord Perceval were returned without opposition. Vernon
had been chosen for several places, and had already taken
his seat for Ipswich. The admiral was regarded by the
populace as a hero of the first water, whose victories, though
for the honour of his country, were thorns in the side of
the Administration, the members of which were accused
of taking bribes from the enemy. The bards compared
Vernon to Cincinnatus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Let Rome no more with ostentation show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her so long-fam’d dictator from the plough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Britain, rival of the Roman name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arts, in elegance, in martial fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can, from the plough, her Cincinnatus fellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show a Vernon storming Porto Bello.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The admiral is further alluded to in another engraving
produced upon this same election&mdash;“The Funeral of
Independency,” where the mourning procession is passing
a tavern with the loyal sign of the Crown and Anchor.
Among other episodes is a man on a donkey, who is galloping
“post to Ipswich 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”&mdash;in allusion to Vernon’s return
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
for that place; while another man is apostrophizing the
rider, “Thou art as tedious as the law.”</p>

<p>The sequel of the memorable Westminster election of
1741 is pictured in “The Triumph of Justice” (Dec. 1741),
an engraving of a satirical character, in which the late
events, the triumph of opposition headed by the Prince of
Wales, and the discomfiture of the Administration, are
figured in allegorical guise. Walpole’s earthly career is
assumed to be finished by the defeat in the Commons, who
voted by a majority of four against the election of that
minister’s placemen; and he is hurried to the tomb. A
sarcophagus is displayed whereon a Satyr, with hour-glass
and scythe, usurps the post of symbolical Time; on the base
of the monument is inscribed “Hic Jacet;” in front is
a medallion of the statesmen supposed to be departed, with
the legend:&mdash;“<i>Padera Robertas Ord: Perisci&mdash;tidis Eques</i>;”
the supporting “weepers” are the disqualified members,&mdash;they
bear a band inscribed “Our Hopes are gone, the
Election’s lost.” Sir Charles Wager, as representing the
admiralty, is leaning on a broken anchor. Lord Sundon
has beside him a coin, two keys, a loaf, some mice (one of
which is caught in a trap), in allusion to the treasury
“loaves and fishes,” parasites, etc. On the ground, across
the reverse of Walpole’s medallion, which bears the legend
“<i>Regit dictus Animos</i>,” are a sceptre and three bludgeons,
“<i>Boroughs</i>” and “<i>Bruisers</i>,” both used for electioneering
purposes, to which a plate marked “Covent Garden”
further alludes.</p>

<p>Above the clouds, and surrounded by an angelic host, is
seated the Prince of Wales, the <i>deus ex machina</i> of
Walpole’s defeat; his sceptre is a bludgeon, and he is
pointing to an orator, who is presumably denouncing
“the king’s party,” whose power is broken. Beside the
heir apparent is a female divinity, balancing the scales of
justice above the figure of Edwin. At the prince’s feet is
seen “the glorious 220,” the number of votes recorded by
the opposition, disqualifying Wager and Sundon, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
favour of a new election for Westminster. The British
crown, decorated with palms and laurels, caps the design;
which is inscribed, on a riband beneath, “<i>To the Independent
Electors of Westminster</i>.” A further allegorical
engraving, appropriately due to Jo. Mynde, exhibits and
commemorates the final stage in this contest, where the
Court was defeated and the opposition scored a complete
triumph; this version, which consists of a design and a
petition, engraved on the same plate, is entitled, “The
Banner of Liberty, displayed in the Petition of the Inhabitants
of Westminster, with the Coat of Arms of the Glorious
two hundred and twenty-two who voted in favour of the
Petitioners.” The emblematical design displays the tutelary
guardian of Westminster, a female figure, seated on the
ground in deep dejection; her hand is resting on the
armorial shield of Charles Edwin, which is placed before
that of Lord Perceval (Earl of Egmont); the arms of
Westminster are engraved on a stone, and the shield of
Admiral Vernon also appears. The goddess of Liberty
has arrived on the scene, she has summarily put “Slavery”
to flight, and while she is assisting the guardian of the
liberties of Westminster to rise, the muskets of the soldiery
are trampled under foot, in allusion to the bold and impolitic
step of ordering grenadiers to close the poll, resorted
to at the previous election by Lord Sundon, to the damage
of his patron Walpole. In the Commons it was suggested
to indict the soldiers who had the temerity to interfere with
“the rights of election.”</p>

<p>The managers of what was called the “Country party”
consisted of those who entitled themselves “patriots,” and
were active in promoting the “good cause.” The victory
which in 1741 unseated Wager and Sundon, and moreover
inflicted so heavy a blow upon Walpole’s influence that he
lost his corrupt majority, and subsequently retired from the
struggle, was annually commemorated by an association of
members of the constituency which had been the first to
assert its independence. An invitation was issued to the
voters to meet together to celebrate this anniversary; a
copperplate, neatly engraved, surmounted by an allegorical
design, and surrounded by an elegant frame or border,
formed the ticket:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Body of Independent Electors of Westminster”
was evidently constituted into a society, at first exclusively
for the furtherance of patriotic views, but, as the Court
party alleged in 1745, to spread Jacobite sentiments. The
excitement evoked by the rising of the Scottish clans and
proclamation of the Young Pretender in 1745 was still at
its height; the gaols were filled with Scotch rebels, and
the famous trial of Lord Lovat, which only commenced on
the 9th of March, was absorbing popular attention to the
extinction of everything but Jacobite plots, both real and
feigned. As the patriotic party had long been in antagonism
with the Court, whose ministers had been defeated
through this influence, and the dissolution of
Parliament was impending, those in office neglected no
opportunity of bringing the so-called “friends of the
people” into evil repute. On the assumption that all
weapons are lawful in electioneering warfare, much political
capital was manufactured out of the Pretender’s <i>fiasco</i>;
and the Scottish Rebellion was seized as an opportunity to
stigmatize all persons of integrity, and those who were
declared enemies of the corrupt Administration then in
power, as Jacobites and sympathizers with the rebels.</p>

<p>“The Independent Electors of the City and Liberty of
Westminster” held their anniversary festival at Vintners’
Hall, on the 19th of March, 1747. The Stewards were the
Earl of Lichfield, Earl of Orrery, Viscount Andover, Sir
R. Bamfylde, George Heathcote, and Thomas Carew. On
this occasion the stewards for the ensuing year were
chosen; they were Lord Ward, Lord Windsor, Sir James
Dashwood, Sir Charles Tynte, Sir Thomas Clarges, and
George Cooke (who was then canvassing Middlesex). On
the conclusion of the business of the afternoon, and after
the festivities, toasts, as was customary, began to be proposed.
<i>The London Evening Post</i> gives a list of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
healths, beginning with “The King;” but, as an implication
of Jacobite proclivities, it is added in another paper
that the royal health was honoured in the recognized
Jacobite fashion&mdash;to “Charley over the Water:”&mdash;“Each
man having a glass of water on the left hand, and waving
the glass of wine over the water,”&mdash;but this accusation was
probably a bold electioneering <i>ruse</i>. The succeeding toasts
were as follows:&mdash;“The Prince;” “The Duke;” “Prosperity
to the independent electors of Westminster;”
“Prosperity to the city of London and the trade thereof;”
“Thanks to the Worshipful Company of Vintners’ for the
use of their Hall;” “The Lord Mayor of London;”
“Success to the arms of Great Britain by sea and land;”
“To the annexing <i>Cape Breton</i> to the Crown of <i>Great
Britain</i>;” “That the spirit of independency may diffuse
itself through the nation;” “That the enemies of <i>Great
Britain</i> may never eat the bread nor drink the drink
thereof;” “That the Naturalization Bill may be kicked
out of the House, and the foreigners out of the kingdom;”
“That the darkening our windows may enlighten our
understanding” (tax upon light); “To all those that dare&mdash;be
honest;” “The stewards elect;” “The late stewards,
with thanks for the trouble they have taken;” “Our old
Friend &mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>According to the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, “amidst this
mirth, one Mr. Williams, Master of the ‘White Horse’ in
Piccadilly, being observed to make memorandums with a
pencil, gave such offence that he was severely cuffed and
kicked out of the company.” It appears that a Jacobite
complexion was given to the rather forcible expression of
public contempt bestowed upon the Ministerial notetaker,
who was branded as “the Spy.” A spirited version of this
incident, executed closely in the manner of Hogarth, if not
by that master, to whose portrait of Lord Lovat it in style
approximates (the artist was himself one of the free electors
of Westminster), exhibits the ignominious ejectment of “the
Spy,” whose detection is further indicated by the paper he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
dropped on the ground, marked “List of the persons, etc.”
The pictorial view of an episode to which undue importance
was attached, owing to the excited relation of parties at the
time, is accompanied by a quotation from “Hudibras”
appropriate to the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 109.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A few days later a second entry shows that it was seriously
entertained at that emergency to carry the matter
farther; in any case&mdash;although they do not seem to have
eventually made anything of it&mdash;the complaint was taken
up by the Commons, and referred to the managers of Lord
Lovat’s trial, then just concluded. On the 24th of March&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Complaint being made to the House that John Williams, keeper
of the ‘White Horse Inn’ in Piccadilly, was on Thursday last, in a
public assembly, assaulted and severely treated, upon a public assertion
made by some persons in that assembly&mdash;‘<i>that</i>, Fraser, <i>said by
them, to be one of the principal witnesses against the Lord Lovat, was
in his custody</i>’ <span class="smcap">ORDER’D</span>. That a committee be appointed to enquire into
the matter of this complaint, and examine persons in the most solemn
manner; that this committee be the managers against Lord Lovat.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole matter is obscured by party misrepresentations.
One James Fraser, who was pronounced a Jacobite,
was active against the Ministerial candidates at the Westminster
contest of 1749, where all opponents of the
Court were denounced as Jacobites, while the “patriots,”
“country party,” and “independent electors of Westminster,”&mdash;as
they indiscriminately christened themselves&mdash;retorted
upon Earl Gower, through his son, Lord Trentham,
the Ministerial candidate for that city, the accusation
of Jacobite leanings:&mdash;“<i>Ask</i> Lord Trentham <i>who had his
foot in the stirrup</i> in the year 1715.”</p>

<p>The parliamentary dissolution followed in June, 1747,
when the favourite manœuvre of those in power was to
recklessly accuse their opponents of belonging to the Stuart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
faction. The odium attaching to the suspicion of Jacobite
tendencies was sufficiently strong to place the “Independent
party” in a smaller minority than at the previous election,
and thus the outbreak in favour of the Pretender served to
recruit the strength of the Court party, which had been
jeopardized at the 1741 election, and had shown signs of
declension before the rising in 1745. The Government
candidates for Westminster, Admiral Sir Peter Warren and
Lord Trentham, were again chosen from the Admiralty.
Lord Trentham was the son of that Earl Gower who was
for some time the head of the Opposition, and at this
juncture was one of the recent recruits of the Court party.</p>

<p>Lord Trentham’s selection as a lord of the admiralty
occurred somewhat later (1749). The second candidate was
Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who, as usual, was supported
by a mob of Jack Tars, or of ruffians dressed in sailors’
clothes for the occasion, a common party subterfuge at the
Westminster elections. The candidates put forward for the
suffrages of the “Independent Electors,” and who came
out of the contest ingloriously, were, as first announced, Sir
Thomas Clarges (one of the stewards of the association)
and Sir John Phillips (who was a steward in 1744); after
a ten-days’ canvass the latter declined to proceed in his
candidature, on the plea of ill health, and Sir Thomas Dyke
was put up in his stead. Early in the contest a well-executed
caricature, in the manner of Boitard or Gravelot, both
artists being contemporary with Hogarth, was offered to
the public under the title of “The Two-Shilling Butcher.”
It was at this election that the highest personages canvassed.
The Duke of Cumberland and the Prince of Wales appeared
in support of the rival factions. In the pictorial view of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
this situation, Lord Trentham, a dandified person dressed
in the extreme of French taste, is in conference with his
“backer” the “Two-Shilling Butcher,” who has been
supposed by Thomas Wright and other authorities to represent
the “Culloden Butcher,” <i>i.e.</i> the Duke of Cumberland.
Mr. F. G. Stephens, who has described all the early
caricatures in the Hawkins Collections with the utmost
pains and minuti&aelig;, sets down this personage as Mr.
Butcher, the agent to the Duke of Bedford, whose residence
is introduced in the rear. However, the figure in the present
version corresponds with similar representations of the
stout Cumberland Butcher; moreover, an allusion to cattle
put into the mouth of this personage strongly indicates, by
analogy with other caricatures on “horned cattle,” that
none other than the duke is meant. The results of the
election were at this time uncertain. The affected lordling,
also satirized as Sir Silkington, is drawling, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>“Curs me!

you’d buy me, ye Brutes, at 2<i>s.</i> p. Head <i>Bona fide</i>?” to which
the figure travestied as a butcher, with apron, knife, and
steel, is responding, “My Lord, there being a Fatality in
ye Cattle, that there is 3000 above my Cut, tho’ I offered
handsome.” The “3000” presumably refers to the Association
of Independent Electors, who, at the previous poll
(1741), registered for the “patriot” candidates (Vernon and
Edwin), but were found wanting in 1747, as the figures at
the close of the poll demonstrated. The Duke of Bedford’s
residence is introduced to recall the circumstance that he
and the candidate were close matrimonial connections, the
duke having married the eldest daughter of John, Earl
Gower. In front of this building, with the “bustos” of
sphinxes above the posts of the gateway, is another
important personage, who is bribing rival canvassers with
gold openly filched from the pockets of Britannia, who is
highly indignant at the proceeding; she is made to exclaim,
with reason, “Ye Gods, what pickpockets!” The people
seen in the dark transaction of being bribed were defectors
from “Phillips and Clarges,” demoralized by the spell of
gold; another voter is hastening away, denouncing the
venality of these persons. One of the sphinxes is exclaiming&mdash;“We
can’t decoy them in!” while labels, carried
through the air by pigeons, record “The Independent has
it,” and “For Yorkshire.” On the opposite side is
shown the front of St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, with its dial
and the motto “So passes ye glory of ye world.” Before its
portals stand the rival candidates, Sir Thomas Clarges and
Sir Thomas Dyke; they are showing their contempt for
mere “placemen representatives” by trampling upon government
bribes: “Places in Exchequer we tread on,” and
“No lucrative Employment.” Near them are the poll clerks,
and the returning officer, with the poll-book under his
charge. Beside the “independent” candidates are shown
their supporters: one of these, bearing in his hand the cap
of liberty, is pressing the latter on the acceptance of the
electors, and assuring them, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>“Those candidates will serve

you!” while a scroll, borne above the heads of the voters,
carries the warning, “No Trentham!”</p>

IN THE SUDS. 1747.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 113.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Other caricatures appeared on the same subject, which
excited, as usual, the largest share of public interest during
the elections throughout the country. One of these first
appeared, in compliment to the Scottish Rebellion, the
latest novelty of the time, as “The Jaco-Independo-Rebello-Plaido.”
In this version the business of the election is
represented to take place before Westminster Hall, as a
further allusion to the Jacobites and Lord Lovat’s trial
there. The two parties and their respective head-quarters,
established at taverns, are represented, and above all
hovers the power of Destruction, always pictured as an
important agent of “the other side,” according to the
respective allegations of the contending parties. The Devil,
in the present instance, is made “to take care of his own,”
and has a stock of halters and axes for the rebels. “I have
the Fee in my hands,” saith the Evil One. One side is
appropriated to Ministerialists at the sign of Jolly Bacchus
and the (Rabbit) Warren. Two persons are leaning from
the first-floor window, and exhorting those with votes to
“Give the Devil his due”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the Jacobites. The most
prominent figure is a butcher; and no doubt, according
to Mr. F. G. Stephens’s suggestion, the person thus implied
is Mr. Butcher, the Duke of Bedford’s agent, and a less
distinguished person than the “Cumberland Duke”
pictured in the “Two-Shilling Butcher.” He is waving
a scroll endorsed, “Trentham and Warren.” The butcher
agent is surrounded by partisans; Admiral Sir Peter
Warren’s sailors (a Lascar among them) are asserting
“bludgeon law;” the people are pushing to the Governmental
head-quarters, crying “No independency” and
“No Pretender,” as if the terms were synonymous; a
Frenchman may be identified in the crowd; and a person
is offering the butcher a paper, “They squeak.” The head-quarters
of the opposite party is shown as a Jacobite
house. The flag displayed is adorned with the figure of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
an owl dressed in a full wig and a counsellor’s bands, and
indicates “Morgan’s Ghost,” the Morgan thus favoured
having been a Jacobite barrister who had the misfortune
to be implicated in the abortive rising of 1745 in the
interests of the Pretender, which cost Morgan his life. The
adherents rallying round this questionable house, intended
as a reflection upon the Association of Independent Electors
of Westminster, who were stigmatized as friends of the
Jacobites, are dressed for the most part in plaids, and
wear Scotch bonnets, to imply their Jacobite sympathies.
This caricature was republished, with the hustings at
Covent Garden substituted for Westminster Hall, and the
Devil very civilly giving place to the figure of an angel,
with the legend “Faithful to King and country.” The
title was changed to “The Humours of the Westminster
Election; or, the Scald Miserable Independent Electors
in the Suds,” 1747, with the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">GREAT BRITAIN’S UNION; OR, THE LITCHFIELD RACES. 1747.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 114.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Strong Jacobite imputations are farther conveyed in the
pictorial version of “Great Britain’s Union; or, the Litchfield
Races, 1747.” Both Whig and Tory parties, not content
with the legitimate and recognized contests of the
hustings, and their ultimate goal, the senate, carried their
partisan proclivities on to the racecourse, and ministerial
and opposition stakes were alternately put into competition
on the same turf. Thus, at Lichfield were held Tory race
weeks, succeeded by similar gatherings on the part of their
opponents. Some rather extraordinary doings occurred
there, the general description of which is conveyed by the
caricature; the two factions by some means came into
collision, and his Grace of Bedford received a sound hiding
with a horsewhip as an acknowledgment of his services
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
to the House of Hanover and his antagonism to the
Patriotic party, denounced as Jacobites by their
Hanoverian rivals; Earl Gower, and his modish son, Lord
Trentham, were also roughly handled. Various freaks of
an extravagant nature were performed, ladies and gentlemen
of the Patriotic faction appearing dressed in Scottish
plaids. In the design this circumstance is specially embodied:
a party of enthusiasts, assembled in a booth on
the course, are toasting the Pretender, whose sun is seen
in the distance, falsely depicted as in the ascendant. A
despondent grenadier outside the Jacobite head-quarters,
is grumbling, “We are rode by Germans;” a cradle, a
Gallic cock, and a <i>fleur-de-lis</i> allude to the Chevalier and
the French assistance lent to his pretensions; overhead
several hands are seen clasped, with the suggestive legend,
“A-greed.” A Frenchified person, pointing to a gamecock
fighting his own shadow, is denouncing the Duke (of
Bedford) in no measured terms; under his right arm is the
whip with which the duke was castigated, and in the left
hand of this valorous bravo is a paper, “We have courage.”
As usual, the Devil is present, and this time he is flying
off with “Information,” possibly to be laid before his dear
friends in office. A sort of zany, seated beneath a flag
marked, “And curse upon denial” (alluding to equivocation
on the part of several), is giving the starting signal.
The Scotch plaid-clad jockey riding for the Chevalier is
beating the Hanoverian jockey on the traditional “White
Horse.” This highly fanciful conception, the reverse of
actual experience, is hailed with extravagant delight by
the excited assembly; the occupants of the Grand Stand
are described as “Don Juan and his friends at the place
of Desert.” Various ballads and satirical productions
were evoked upon the transaction related.</p>

<p>Lord Trentham, his father, Earl Gower, and their great
relative, the Duke of Bedford, are, with various references
to the late election for Westminster, introduced into
several caricatures which followed, and notably in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>“Great

Britain’s Union; or, Litchfield Races transposed,” “A
Sight of the Banging Bout at Litchfield,” and “An Exact
Representation” of the same occurrence. The circumstances
to which these pictorial satires refer are traceable
to the national ferment succeeding the suppression of the
Rebellion, when, as recapitulated, various eccentricities
were committed by those who favoured the Pretender’s
cause; among others, certain Staffordshire sportsmen made
themselves conspicuous. Smollett, in his “History of
England,” describes these vagaries: the Stuart partisans&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“appeared in the Highland taste of variegated drapery, and, their
zeal descending to a very extraordinary exhibition of practical
ridicule, they hunted with hounds clothed in plaid, a fox dressed in
red uniform. Even the females at their assembly and the gentlemen
at the races affected to wear the chequered stuff by which the prince-pretender
and his followers had been distinguished. Divers noblemen
on the course were insulted as apostates; and one personage of high
rank is said to have undergone a very disagreeable flagellation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The sequel of this adventure is related in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> (1748):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Before Mr. Justice Burnett, took place the trial of the information
against Toll (a dancing-master) and others, for insulting and
striking the Duke of Bedford, and other gentlemen, upon Whittington
Heath, at the late Litchfield horse-races; when it was likewise proposed
by the counsel for the defendants, that the several rioters, to the
number of thirteen, should submit to be found guilty: if the counsel
for the crown would consent to withdraw the information against
several other persons concerned in that riot.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances of the <i>fracas</i> are also alluded to in
the “Letters of Junius” (xxii.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Heston Humphrey, a country attorney, horsewhipped the
duke with equal justice, severity, and perseverance on the course at
Litchfield. Rigby and Lord Trentham were also cudgelled in a most
exemplary manner.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These incidents gave rise to various ballads as well as
caricatures; a parody on “Chevy Chase” offers the liveliest
version of the affair:&mdash;

<p>In 1749, Lord Trentham, having been appointed one of

every exertion was made by the Opposition to hinder his
re-election.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“With this view they held consultations, agreed to resolutions,
and set up a private gentleman named Sir George Vandeput as the
competitor of Lord Trentham, declaring that they would support his
pretensions at their own expense; being the more encouraged to this
enterprise by the countenance and assistance of the Prince of Wales
and his adherents. They accordingly opened houses of entertainment
for their partisans, solicited votes, circulated remonstrances, and
propagated abuse; in a word, they canvassed with surprising spirit
and perseverance against the whole interest of St. James’s. Mobs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
were hired, and processions made on both sides, and the city of
Westminster was filled with tumult and uproar.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This election occurred in the midst of a violent popular
anti-Gallican feeling, which had been shown particularly
against a company of French players who were performing
at the Haymarket, and who were spoken of by the mob as
the “French vagrants.” An attempt had been made to
hinder them from acting, and they had been protected only
by a mob hired by Lord Trentham, who appears to have
affected Gallic manners, and to have been vain of his
proficiency in the French language. The night after his
ministerial appointment there was a great riot at the
French theatre, in which Lord Trentham was accused of
being personally active, although he denied it to the
electors. This was made the most of by his opponents,
who stigmatized him in ballads and squibs as “the
champion of the French <i>strollers</i>;” and common people
said that learning to talk French was only a step towards
the introduction of French tyranny.</p>

<p>An “Elector” writes, by way of warning to others:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Being the other evening at the French Theatre, who should I see
at the head of a mob of foreign varlets, cooks, etc., signalizing himself
in a laudable attack upon his fellow-citizens, but this very young man,
whom they had so lately made choice of as the defender of their rights
and privileges. I was indeed amazed to see, at so critical a juncture,
that sword, which had hitherto kept peaceful possession of its scabbard,
brandished over the heads and planted at the hearts of several of his
own electors, and that in support of a parcel of foreign vagabonds,
who, from being a nuisance in their own nation, are now come to be
the disgrace of ours. Certain I am this fit of Gallic valour could
never be communicated by the touch of that Royal British hand he
had but that very morning kissed for his employment. Perhaps an
impatient desire to prove himself qualified for the warlike Board to
which he was appointed might induce him to seize the first opportunity
of displaying his prowess; being willing to convince the public, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
how deficient soever the sea may have been, the land is, at least, able
to produce a fighting Admiral. However, I cannot help concluding
him a very unfit person to defend me <i>against</i> the French in one House,
who is ready to cut my throat <i>for</i> them in another.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption">BRITANNIA DISTURBED BY FRENCH VAGRANTS. LORD TRENTHAM FOR WESTMINSTER. 1749.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 121.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The caricaturists endorsed this view. In “Britannia
Disturbed, or an Invasion by French Vagrants, addressed
to the worthy Electors of the City of Westminster,” 1749,
Lord Trentham is trying to force these importations on
Britannia, who is nursing “Lunn” (Rich), and “Fribble;”
these she declares “are my only Theatrical children, I will
cherish no Foreign vagrants.” “Peg” Trentham, with
drawn sword, is asserting that he will perforce cram these
“entertaining dear creatures” down the throat of the
nation; the strollers are like marionettes, and wear
wooden shoes, as a hint of French neediness. Earl Gower
is anxious for his rash scion’s future prospects: “My long-headed
son will smart for this scheme.” “Push on, my
Lord,” is the encouragement of “a subscriber.” “Bludgeon-men,
at two shillings a day,” engaged for the election, are
making a demonstration of force, and shouting for their
employer’s glorification.</p>

<p>This Westminster election is said to have been one
of the most expensive contests that the Government had
as yet experienced. The following epigram describes a
supposed conversation between Lord Trentham and his
father:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>At the conclusion of the polling there appeared a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
majority for Lord Trentham, but his opponents demanded
a scrutiny; and this scrutiny proved so laborious and
difficult, or the parties interested in opposing the Court
threw so many obstacles in the way, that it led to a quarrel
with the House of Commons, which lasted some months,
and gave a double celebrity to the Westminster Election of
1749.</p>

<p>The most was made of Lord Trentham’s Gallic proclivities,
which were held up to ridicule in ingenious
satires. The following handbill is an example of the squibs
circulated by his opponents during the election:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The general election of 1747 furnished Hogarth with
a suggestion which employed his attention anterior to his
more ambitious election series. The House of Commons
dissolved on the 18th of June, and the artist, taking time by
the forelock, had his engraving “A Country Inn-yard at
the Time of Election” ready for publication while the
contests were occupying the public. As the print in
question informs us, the cry of a “Babe of grace,” heard
at the City election of 1701, was repeated in 1747. The
subject of the stage-coach and inn-yard is generally
familiar. It contains the figures of the fat woman of
abnormal proportions being assisted into the coach by
the efforts of her meagre husband; while the equally
obese landlady, seen at the bar window, which she fills,
is vigorously pulling the bell to summons the coach
passengers. It is the background of the picture which
illustrates the present subject. The sleek landlord, wearing
an apron, and with a pair of snuffers pendent at his girdle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
is presenting to an election agent a bill for the expenses
incurred for the entertainment of his party; that the
amount is excessive is conveyed by the expression of
suspicion which pervades the features of the agent, who
is preparing to settle the account; the landlord is evidently
protesting as to his immaculate reputation, while
a part of the <i>Act</i> against bribery on elections is projecting
from his pocket. The galleries of the inn-yard are filled
with spectators, who are favoured with a sight of the
humours of an election procession&mdash;a posse of men
carrying sticks and bearing an effigy of a more than
life-size baby, with a child’s rattle and hornbook, or
A.B.C. Behind the chair, in which this figure is seated,
is carried a flag with the inscription, “No Old Baby.”
Nichols and Stevens, in their “Notes to Hogarth” (1810)
have explained that the “Old Baby” effigy and cry were
resorted to by the antagonists of the Hon. John Child, whose
family, by Act of Parliament, took the name of Tylney
in 1735. This candidate stood member for the county
of Essex in opposition to Sir Robert Abdy and Mr. Bramstone.
At the election, a man was placed on a bulk, with
a mock infant in his arms, who, as he whipped the babe
in effigy, exclaimed, “What, you little Child, must you be
a member?” The member in question was then Viscount
Castlemaine, and afterwards Earl Tylney. At this disputed
election, it appeared, from the register book of the parish
where this candidate was born, that he was a “Child” in
more than one respect, being but twenty years of age when
returned for parliament.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="medium">SATIRES ON THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS OF 1754.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">A favourite figure with the satirists was to portray wily
party manœuvrers as vermin-catchers, and those apostate
representatives who were ready to sell themselves and
their parliamentary trust were displayed as the spoils of
their craft. A cartoon appeared at the time of these
elections reflecting upon the tricks of administration. It
will be seen that nearly all these early caricaturists seem
disinterested, as their subjects oppose the dispensers of
patronage. The engraving shows the Duke of Newcastle
seated beside St. Stephen’s Chapel, and fishing for partisans
among the late members, and, in anticipation, bidding for the
adherence of the possible representatives in the coming
parliament; this subject is entitled, “The Complete Vermin-Catcher
of Great Britain; or, the Old Trap new baited.”
The minister’s line is dropped through the chimney of
St. Stephen’s, and is baited with <i>Titles</i>, <i>Bribes</i>, <i>Places</i>,
<i>Pensions</i>, <i>Secret Commissions</i>, and patronage in <i>Army</i>,
<i>Navy</i>, and <i>Excise</i>. The intriguing duke, who was a
proficient in corrupting others, and spent a large fortune
in electioneering wiles, is observing, “All Vermin may be
caught, tho’ differently, suit but the Bait to their various
appetites. But there’s a species will take no Bait; would
I could scare them away; as they’re not Vermin, they will
not answer my purpose.” The greedy place-hunters are
swarming plentifully, and are offering to do any amount of
dirty work, to “push for posts,” “Jews and no Jews,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
being indifferent to everything but profit. The Pelhams,
unscrupulous themselves, were past-masters of the art of
finding venal tools. It is disclosed in the diary of Bubb
Dodington (Lord Melcombe-Regis), the manager of the
Leicester House intrigues, and himself an accomplished
adept in dissimulation, how disreputably the Duke of
Newcastle contrived to secure Bubb’s parliamentary
influence (six seats) “for nothing!”</p>

<p>The corrupt character of a large average of those sent to
the Commons as representatives of the people was in
perfect keeping with the no less greedy boroughmongers
who found them seats and the mercenary voters, their constituents
by presumption; what a man bought&mdash;and in those
days almost everything political had its price and was
purchasable&mdash;he held himself justified in selling when the
chance occurred. A satirical rendering of the imperfections
then supposed to affect the body of the senate appeared at
the time of these elections of 1754, when, by wholesale
bribery, the Administration was, at an enormous cost, doing
its utmost to degrade the entire system of representation:&mdash;“Dissection
of a Dead Member (of Parliament).” The
subject is extended upon a table for autopsy, five surgeons
have severally examined the different functions, and the
results of their post-mortem inspection is thus stated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>1st Doctor.</i> The Brain is very foul and muddy, it has a Contusion,
or, as it may be called, a soft place in it, locked in the stone kitchen
by way of qualification.</p>

<p><i>2nd Doctor.</i> Ay, ay, he knocked his head too hard against politics
and bruisified his pericranium. He was bred a Foxhunter.</p>

<p><i>3rd Doctor.</i> The <i>Vena Cava</i> of the <i>Thorax</i> makes a noise, and
sounds as if one should say, “My country be damn’d,” and his intestines
have got, I think, ’tis “Bribery,” wrote on them&mdash;not a drop of good
blood in his heart.</p>

<p><i>4th Doctor.</i> Bribery, the <i>Auri Sacra fames</i> of the ancients&mdash;ay
’twas a diet he was fond of, ’twas his Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper,
and affected all the corpuscles of his corporeal system, it was his
<i>Insanible Membrum</i>.</p>

<p><i>5th Doctor.</i> There’s a most potent Fœtor exhales as if the whole
body was corrupted&mdash;if the bones are touched it won’t make an Anatomy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The elections of 1754 are rendered more interesting to
later generations from the circumstance that the famous
series of paintings by Hogarth, better known by the
engravings as the “Four Plates of an Election,” owe their
origin to the electoral contests which ensued on the
parliamentary dissolution, April 8, 1754. Before that date
the tendency of events was shadowed forth. For instance,
Henry Pelham, a pupil of Walpole’s, who combined the
offices of first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the
exchequer, passed the Jews’ Naturalization Bill in June,
1753, chiefly by his own exertions; but reaping thereby an
enlarged measure of unpopularity&mdash;sufficient to jeopardize
his party and his future career, if not to extinguish the
political prospects of the Pelhams beyond rehabilitation&mdash;this
detrimental concession was recalled, and, in the face
of a general election and its possible eventualities, the Bill
was repealed. The hostile feeling provoked by the measure
in question still remained, and although the principal agent
on its introduction had himself departed, it exercised, as
will be seen in the political satires, much influence over
the elections of 1754, in the way of helping the return of
fresh opposition candidates, and defeating ministerial
nominees. Henry Pelham, the prominent figure of the
administration, expired in the full tide of his unpopularity.
That enmity&mdash;consequent upon his acts&mdash;followed him to
the tomb is illustrated by a spirited caricature, published
on his death, and disclosing the probable reception which
awaited the late premier on the other side of the Styx.
“His Arrival at his Country Retirement and Reception,”
March 6, 1754 (the anniversary of Pelham’s decease).
In this etching Henry Pelham is entering on his future
state, introduced to the infernal regions by a demon
chamberlain. The “salle des pas perdus,” is not so easy
as anticipated; Pelham is observing to his conductor:&mdash;“It
was much easier walking in the Treasury. I hope my
successor finds it so.” The ghosts of departed statesmen
are variously greeting the arrival of the latest addition to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
their class. His predecessor, Sir Robert Walpole, is
welcoming a worthy pupil: “O, this is a child of my own
bringing up. I found him a promising Genius for dirty work,
I therefore did all I could to gain him the succession at my
retirement hither, knowing that some of his black strokes
would make me appear as fair as alabaster. He has done
it in several respects, but chiefly in getting the Naturalization
of the Jews passed,&mdash;have any of you great Genius’s
done anything equal?” The spirit of Judge Jeffreys is
declaring, “All my transactions in the West were but a
joke to that great achievement.” The disembodied Cardinal
Wolsey is observing, “Is that the choice spirit you have so
often described? I made pretty large strides towards making
the people swallow down what I thought proper&mdash;but this
beats all my ‘<i>Ego et Rex Meus’s</i>’ out of doors!” A shade
affirms, “We are all puny statesmen to him;” and the
most astute politicians of history are voted beginners beside
Pelham&mdash;“If you, old Machiavel, had known him in your
days, he’d a’ lent you a lift.”</p>

<p>In the elections which were held in April, 1754, the
Court seems to have experienced less opposition than might
have been expected; for although the spirit of the antagonistic
“Leicester House party” had been damped by the
death of the Prince of Wales, which occurred unexpectedly
in March, 1751, it now showed signs of reviving.</p>

<p>The contest for the City of London gave rise to several
interesting caricatures. The humours of canvassing are
displayed in “The Liveryman’s Lev&eacute;e” (April, 1754),
which represents an elector, a self-sufficient tailor, with
his vulgar wife. The pair are receiving the obsequious bows
of five of the candidates, who, in 1754, put up for the City
of London. The absence of Sir John Barnard, the celebrated
city patriot, is professionally marked by a suit hanging on
the wall,&mdash;“A Plain Suit of Broadcloth for Sir John
Steady.” The liveryman is insolently resenting the
independence of the favourite candidate: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>“Where’s Sir
John? I think he is greatly wanting in his duty. Does he

imagine that a man of my figure is to be trifled with?
Don’t he know that we expect to be waited on?” There
are other allusions to the recommendations for and
objections against the respective candidates.</p>

<p>As the dissolution of parliament approached, satirical
views of the situation became numerous, and there appeared
various well-executed caricatures upon the subject
of the city election. In “The City Up and Down; or,
the Candidates Pois’d,” the candidates were represented
perched upon suspended boxes, part of a huge revolving
machine. Sir John Barnard, Slingsby Bethel, and William
Beckford are occupying the upper seats; they had represented
the city in the last parliament, and, as there were
no objections against their names, their re-election was
considered secure. In a side box is Sir Richard Glyn,
who was defeated; in another, somewhat lower, is Sir
Robert Ladbrooke, a new candidate, who was successful;
below these is a fourth box, in which are Sir Crisp
Gascoyne and Sir William Calvert; the latter, though
one of the former representatives, secured the fewest
votes in 1754. The reason for this falling-off in favour
is explained by the caricature; Calvert is surrounded
by Jews, who are assuring him:&mdash;“You have all our
interest, for your zealous support of our Bill!”&mdash;“Confound
your Bill; now I have no hope left,” replies Sir
William, whose exertions on behalf of this measure lost
him his seat. Barnard is declaring, “I am, strictly speaking,
neither a friend to the Jews nor their enemy; excepting
when they aim at having equal Rights and Privileges
with my fellow-citizens and countrymen.” While the
inflexible Beckford, who later was Lord Chatham’s
“mouth-piece in the Commons,” asserts, “It becomes
a Man of Character to keep good Company.” Ladbrooke,
who was a distiller, is declaring he “should like to be in
good company too,” but “fears it will be with the two
kings”&mdash;“The King of the Jews” being Calvert the brewer,
and Gascoyne, “King of the Gipsies.” There are allusions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
to the occupations of the candidates; the voters are
declaring, “If the gin-merchant [Ladbrooke] gets in, gin
will be cheaper.” Other electors refer to Gascoyne and
Calvert as “two very good beer-makers.” On the opposite
side of the river is shown Sampson Gideon, a prominent
financier of his day, and afterwards knighted,&mdash;he is conducted
by Satan, and his hat is filled with gold for purposes
of bribery; he is eager to tamper with the balance of the
boxes in the “great Up and Down machine;”&mdash;“If I was
over I would turn the poise, though it cost me the profits
of the last Lottery.” Gideon was a strenuous supporter
of those who voted for the Jews’ Naturalization Bill, and,
before the repeal of that measure, held hopes of getting
into parliament. He is frequently alluded to in the electioneering
squibs of the time. That he had substantial
reasons for interesting himself in behalf of those in power
appears from the “Report of the Committee appointed to
investigate the Lottery of 1753,” where it is stated that
“Sampson Gideon became proprietor of more than six
thousand tickets, which he sold at a premium.” Preference
allotments, being highly profitable, were useful as
administrative patronage.</p>

<p>The city election is further illustrated by an engraving
called, “A Stir in the City; or, some Folks at Guildhall,”
which represents various groups of citizens and persons
prominent at the time, assembled before the Guildhall,
while the six candidates are borne along on a long frame
with six seats, and supported on men’s shoulders, the procession
being headed by a bishop; the party is received in
state by the sheriffs, who are assuring the prelate, “as my
Lord Rabbi,” that “the Guildhall is not the Synagogue,”
and “no sons of Levi have place here;”&mdash;in general, the
bishops supported the Naturalization Bill. Dr. Ward, then
before the public as an advertizing pill-vendor, is from his
coach distributing quack nostrums; he is acknowledging
that “not one will cure an Election Fever.” Gascoyne
and Mary Squires, the gipsy, crooked and leaning on her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
staff, are represented, with Hogarth beside them; this
refers to the charges against Squires brought by Elizabeth
Canning, and proved false on further investigation
by Sir C. Gascoyne, who retired from the city canvass,
and successfully contested Southwark. Candidates for
Hertford, Winchester, and other places are also introduced.
A group of Jews stand by the Guildhall; one
cries, “What a shame it is we have no votes!” Sampson
Gideon is present, and another is confidentially remarking
to him, “Tho’ you can’t vote, Sampson, you may still
do business there;” to which the contractor replies, in
reference to his expectation of sitting in parliament had
the Act to remove the disabilities of the Jews continued
in force, “I thought to have voted in another Building;”
while a lean Hebrew neighbour whispers, “You have
an excellent hand at a Lottery, all the world knows.”
Orator Henley, standing in his tub, is recommending his
butcher friends from Newport Market to convert the voters
into Jews; and a hawker is crying, “Sir Andrew Freeport’s
Address [to the Livery of London] for nothing.”
The state of the polls for London and Oxfordshire are also
given.</p>

<p>Of the six candidates carried in chairs, two and two, Sir
John Barnard (at the head of the poll, 3553), is saying,
“These are my fellow-citizens; I must not forsake them in
my old age, for I always loved them.” Slingsby Bethel
(3547), as president of the Free British Fishery Society,
promises “the Herring Fishery shall thrive.” Beckford
(2941) is made to declare, “I’ll vote for a new Bridge
[Blackfriars]; but not for a new Jew Bill.” Sir R. Ladbrooke
(3390) is present, and so are the defeated candidates,
Sir Richard Glyn, and, at the bottom of the poll, Sir W.
Calvert, with the Jew Bill in his pocket&mdash;for which he
asserts he “only voted!”</p>

<p>A further explanation of the allusions conveyed in this
satire is afforded by the verses which accompanied the
design:&mdash;

</div>

<p>The struggle for election was also epitomized under the
popular paraphrase of a race-course: “The Parliamentary
Race; or, the City Jockies” (April, 1754). Sir John Barnard
is first on “Steady,” Mr. Slingsby Bethel is second on
“Buzzard;” Sir R. Ladbrooke on “Trimmer,” and William
Beckford on “Will o’ the Wisp,” are making great exertions
to cut out Sir Richard Glyn on “Little Driver,” who is
flogging his horse to keep the third place, which he ultimately
lost, his name standing fifth at the close of the poll;
Sir Crisp Gascoyne is left behind with “Miss Canning;”
Sir William Calvert has come to grief, his horse, “Loose
Legs,” having stumbled over a Jew pedlar, and, with the
rider, been thrown out of the race. The contest is witnessed
by horsemen, gentlemen on foot occupying the stand which
the horses must pass, and the usual crowd of spectators
present on a race-course, including an itinerant gin-seller
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
dispensing spirits to workmen, in allusion to the distiller,
Sir R. Ladbrooke. Various observations are made on the
chances of the race: “Old Steady [Barnard] is in first!”
“Buzzard [Bethel] will blunder in second!” “Will o’
the Wisp [Beckford] has blood in him!” and other comments,
as indicated above. The state of the “Parliamentary
Stakes” is expounded in a copy of verses, possibly
a parody after one of Tom D’Urfey’s odd ditties:&mdash;</p>

<p>The summary of both the London and the Oxfordshire
contests, which were regarded by ministers as of the utmost
consequence, are given pictorially in a carefully engraved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
print, entitled “All the World in a Hurry; or, the Road
from London to Oxford,” April, 1754. At the extremities
of the plate are views of the respective cities; to these
the candidates and their supporters are proceeding on
horse and foot, by two opposite lines of road. To the right,
where the London cavalcade may be taken to commence,
the largest mounted figure, and that nearest the spectator,
is intended for Sir John Barnard, the head of the poll, who
is trotting along at a steady pace, contented with his
progress: “My steed is slow, but sure, Sir Robert.” Sir
Robert Ladbrooke, who is urging on his own career, replies,
“What! without a spur, Sir John?”&mdash;Barnard having
resorted to no election manœuvres, and not even canvassed
the voters. Alderman Slingsby Bethel, jogging along
comfortably in his gig, is observing; “I’ll leave my
Election to the Arbitration of the Livery.” Sir Richard
Glyn’s pace, in a post-chaise and pair, is checked by a
group of pedestrians in the pathway; “What the Devil
can’t you get before the Jews, Tom?” he is inquiring of
his postillion, who replies, “They are in possession of the
Road, Sir Richard:” Glyn, although for some time third
in the voting, finally failed in his election. Also behind
the group of foot-passengers are two prosperous-looking
personages on horseback, Sir William Calvert and William
Beckford, both late members for the city; the former is
bantering his companion, “You won’t be first at Guildhall,
Brother Beckford;” the famous patriot was returned third
on the poll at the election of 1754: his rival retorts,
alluding to Calvert’s position at the previous contest,
“Nor you second, Sir William;” the support Calvert had
lent the Jews’ Naturalization Bill was the cause of his
being rejected in 1754. In the centre of the group of
Hebrew obstructives is a stout man, mopping his forehead
and complaining, as he drags along wearily, “Verily,
England is too hot at this time of the year!”&mdash;this figure
represents Sir Sampson Gideon, the loan contractor, who
is surrounded by his co-religionists. One long-bearded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Israelite is crying that “Sampson refuses to sweat a little
for our friend Sir William!” (Calvert); another Jew
declares, “Sir William has been sweated often on our
account;” and a third is saying, “We must give him a
little Grease for once” (<i>i.e.</i> spend money to further his
election),&mdash;this refers to the encouragement the Jews
offered Sir William Calvert, support rendered in return for
his assistance in passing the Jews’ Naturalization Bill,
which nearly cost the ministry their working majority,
while one of the city members, Calvert, the great brewer
of the day, lost both his popularity and his place in
parliament. This measure had been passed by the Pelhams
in the last session, and, until its repeal, Sampson Gideon
looked forward to a seat as a representative of the City of
London. On the eve of the dissolution the ministers had
repealed their unpopular Bill, and this concession to public
opinion was regarded as an electioneering stratagem on
their part. At the other end of the London group is Sir
Crisp Gascoyne, who gave up his candidature for the city,
and put up for Southwark, where he was rejected. At this
time Sir Crisp was labouring under undeserved disfavour
owing to his exertions to procure the conviction of Elizabeth
Canning, the perjuress, for a false accusation against the
gipsy, Mary Squires, who was, through Canning’s devices,
condemned to death, but was subsequently pardoned, after
Gascoyne’s investigation had established her innocence,
and the true facts were made public. The case in question,
which was not cleared up at the time of the elections, was
the cause of that unpopularity which cost Sir Crisp his seat;
in the engraving, he is made to exclaim, “Why, where are
you, Mother Squires, with your infernal troop?”&mdash;Squires
was alleged to be a witch! A friend riding beside him is
pointing upwards, “Infernal! Sir Crisp? why, they are up
in the air yonder!”&mdash;indicating a witch and three weird
sisters riding on broomsticks over the heads of the parliamentary
cavalcade. The leader, intended for the gipsy,
is exclaiming, “I am afraid we are too late, sisters.” The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
spectators are standing aside to let the procession pass;
one is shouting bravely for the “tried members, Barnard
and England for ever, huzza!” and two others are abusing
Gideon’s friends, who have hindered Calvert’s election.
“Damn the Jews! they are always in the way,” “Turn
’em out of the Road.” A copy of verses further elucidates
the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>The half of the engraving of “All the World in a
Hurry,” having reference to the Oxfordshire elections, may
be taken as an introduction to Hogarth’s famous series of
“The Election;” the actual candidates, besides the contest,
being set forth in this earlier version.</p>

<p>The two horsemen galloping in advance of their competitors
represent Lord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood, the
“True Blue” candidates, who gained the head of the poll,
and were returned as “sitting members,” but were afterwards,
“on a controverted election petition,” displaced to
make room for Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner, the
representatives of the ruling party, who had been supported
from the first with the entire government interest, and by
a decision of the House of Commons were ultimately seated.</p>

<p>In the engraved version of this spirited competition,
Lord Wenman is made to remark, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>“They are not far behind

us, Sir James;” to which Dashwood responds, “Too far,
my lord, to get up with us.” That every exertion was
made is illustrated by the driver of the post-chaise which
contains the ministerial nominees; the Duke of Marlborough,
as postillion, is declaring “his jades, <i>i.e.</i> the voters, begin to
kick”&mdash;the elections for Oxfordshire having been in the
control of the Marlborough family at former elections;
and, in fact, the same influence was so preponderating, that
no opposition after the election of 1754, now in question,
was offered in the county until 1826,&mdash;another Sir G.
Dashwood was unsuccessful in the Whig interest in 1830.
Sir Edward Turner and Lord Parker are in the ministerial
post-chaise; the duke is proposing to throw over one of his
nominees&mdash;“Sir Edward, you had better get out;” his
colleague, however, is resisting this desertion&mdash;“You won’t
leave me single, Sir Edward?” The latter is trying to spur
their postillion forwards: “Push hard, my Lord Duke, or
we shan’t get in.” Two Whig notabilities are riding at
a distance; one is observing, “Sir James [Dashwood] and
my Lord [Wenman] have got ground on ’em;” his neighbour
is confidently replying, “Ay, and they’ll keep it, my
boys.”</p>

<p>Last comes the great man of the administration, driving
his phaeton and six. He bids a mounted messenger to
“ride forward, and tell my Lord Duke I would have been with
him, but my horses took fright at a funeral, and won’t pull
together;” the Duke of Newcastle is the person represented,
and the circumstance to which he attributes the restiveness
of his six-in-hand was the death, just before the dissolution
of parliament, of his brother Henry Pelham, a man of
superior abilities to the duke, who had filled the same
offices with a better hold on his team.</p>

<p>The elections in Oxfordshire were marked by a more
animated conflict than elsewhere; the Jacobite faction was
still strong there, although the comparatively recent fate
of those who had declared for the Pretender served to keep
these sympathies within discreet limits. The contest was
strongly marked by incidents which have survived in the
four famous election pictures painted by William Hogarth,
the unequalled originals of which, still in fine condition,
are now somewhat lost to the public in Sir John Soane’s
Museum,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> but of which the engravings are most familiar.
Hogarth sold the series to his friend David Garrick for the
modest price of 200 guineas; at the sale of Mrs. Garrick’s
effects, in 1823, they were secured by Sir John Soane for
the corresponding moderate sum of &pound;1732 10<i>s.</i> The
“Election Entertainment” was exhibited at Spring Gardens
in 1761. These characteristic satires seem to apply to
electioneering episodes in general, not only of the eighteenth
century, but until within the present; a recapitulation of
the principal allusions, however, will show that these
pictures are composed of studies for the most part drawn
from life, and founded on the actualities of the 1754
contest in Oxfordshire. The “Election Entertainment,”
the first of these plates, is so well known that it was felt
unnecessary to reproduce any of its incidents. This scene
might he taken as a generalistic view of the electioneering
hospitality and “open house,” one of the first steps
towards conciliating support, but that the three “party-cries”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
distinctive of this particular struggle are all
pictorially perpetuated. The scene embodies gluttony,
turbulence, and false patriotism, but bribery and violent
intimidation prevail above all. The mayor, who occupies
the seat of honour, has succumbed to a surfeit of oysters,
and a phlebotomist of the barber tribe is endeavouring to
blood his arm and cool his head at one time. A ministerial-looking
personage is treated with coarse familiarity, while
a youthful aspirant for popular favour is submitting to
tipsified indignities at the hands of his temporary associates.
Nichols, who mentions certain assurances he
received from Hogarth as to the fact that, with one
exception, none of the figures were intended for portraits,
affects to recognize the handsome candidate.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> This modish
gentleman has been treating the fair sex to gloves, buff or
orange favours, and other gear, from the pack of a pedlar
of the Hebrew persuasion, who is also dealing in notes of
hand; he holds one for &pound;20 from the candidate, signed
“R. Pention” (Pension being the word). While the
Court party is regaling the Buffs, or Old Interest, at the
leading tavern, their opponents, the Blues, are making
an out-of-door demonstration; so that a view of the
humours of both sides is simultaneously afforded. The
New Interest procession is composed of “bludgeon-men,”
bearing an effigy of the Duke of Newcastle, with
the colours of the Old Interest, and a placard round
his neck, “No Jews,” in allusion to the unpopular Act
introduced by the Pelhams (1752) to permit the naturalization
of foreign Jews. Another cry, inscribed on a blue
standard, is “Liberty and Prosperity,” while a huge blue
flag bears the inscription, “Increase and multiply in spite
of old &mdash;&mdash;,”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> in reference to the recent Act for the regulation
of marriages, which had encountered much opposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
and given offence to the multitude. An animated exchange
of missiles between the political antagonists is proceeding
through the window; those within are standing a siege
from showers of bricks, to which they are replying with
a volley of fluids and furniture showered on the heads of
the passing patriots; while a rival detachment of Old
Interest hirelings, displaying their orange cockades, being
armed with oak cudgels, and headed by a partisan with a
drawn sword, is sallying forth to make a diversion on the
besiegers. A champion Orange bludgeon-man, seated on
the floor in the foreground, has evidently returned from
a raid on the foe, in which he has had his head broken,
but he has succeeded in carrying off one of the obnoxious
blue standards. A butcher, with a “Pro Patria” favour
twisted round his head, is pouring gin upon the bruiser’s
cracked cranium, which he has first plastered with a
“Your vote and interest” card; the doughty champion is
reviving his spirits with the same stimulant; his foot is
trampling upon the spoils of victory, the broken staff and
the flag inscribed, “Give us our eleven days,”&mdash;another
whimsical popular party cry, explained by the alteration
in the style, introduced in the session 1751, to correct
the calendar according to the Georgian computation, then
adopted by most European nations. To equalize the
number of days, so that the new year should in future
begin on the 1st of January, eleven intermediate days
were for that occasion passed over between the 2nd and
14th of September, 1752, so that the day succeeding the
2nd of that month would be reckoned as the 14th&mdash;an
alteration which provoked discontent, and, in spite of its
obvious convenience, was denounced as a Popish innovation.</p>

<p class="noindent">The business of the meeting, regarding the gluttony and
drunkenness among the diversions, is centred in bribery.
The Buff parliamentary agent has a seat next the unconscious
municipal in the chair; before him is a ledger
ruled with columns for “sure votes” and “doubtful.” The
occupations of this important factotum are deranged by
a flying brick from the opposition, which has struck home
on his temple, bringing him down headlong, with destruction
to objects around. Amid much horse-play and practical
joking&mdash;to the strains of an extraordinary orchestra&mdash;promises
of payment, bank-notes, and broad-pieces
are being put into circulation. A lean Methodist tailor,
with Blue sympathies, and who is suffering from qualms
of conscience, is placed between two fires, the personal
violence of his wife, with a half-shod offspring appealing
for new shoes, while a clerkly agent is pressing on his
acceptance a handful of silver coins to remove his pious
scruples. Although bribery was so generally admitted,
and stalked barefaced throughout the country, it was
even then contrary to statute. With his usual irony, the
painter has shown the “Act against Bribery and Corruption”
turned into pipe-lights, and thrown aside in the
tray of “long clays,” together with a packet of tobacco,
for the use of smokers. This latter bears the name of
“Kirton’s best,” and has its peculiar significance: Nichols
records that Kirton “was a tobacconist by St. Dunstan’s
Church, Fleet Street, who ruined his health and constitution,
as well as impaired his circumstances, by being
busy in the Oxfordshire election of 1754.” The pictures
on the walls, according to Hogarth’s practice, greatly assist
the story: there is a view, presumably of Oxford from the
river&mdash;the city is represented in flames; an undertaker’s
escutcheon&mdash;the field sable bears three gold pieces, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
a chevron, the motto “Speak and Have,” surmounted by
an open mouth by way of crest proper. A portrait of
William, Prince of Orange, as the Protestant prince of
the Revolution, has been slashed across by rabid and
indignant Jacobites, in allusion to the faction then supposed
to have had much influence in Oxford; branches
of laurel are entwined round a buff flag, marked “Liberty
and Loyalty,” the standard of the party.</p>

<p>Further allusions to the respective Houses of Stuart
and Hanover may be detected in the plate, “Canvassing
for Votes,” in the signs of the “Royal Oak,” <i>versus</i> “The
Crown.” All the taverns are pressed into the service of
the candidates as a matter of course, the enterprising
competitors striving to secure the preponderance of publicans,
their interest, friends, and followers. “Tim Partitool,
Esq.,” possibly a hit at Bubb Dodington, whose
person, as sketched by Hogarth, may be identified in at
least one picture of this series, is located at the “Royal
Oak.” This enterprising gentleman, as depicted on his
canvass, is nicknamed “Punch,” also indicative of Bubb’s
unmistakable figure. A porter has brought two packages,
evidently polling cards, inscribed, “Sir, your vote and
interest;” one of these parcels is directed “at Punch’s,
at the ‘Royal Oak’ Yard,” and to the candidate in question
the bearer is presenting a note with the superscription,
“Tim Partitool, Esq.” Above this gentleman’s head, and
partly concealing the painted signboard of Charles II. in
the oak, with the three crowns of the United Kingdom
among the branches, is a pictorial poster in two compartments.
In the upper one are shown the Treasury and
Horse Guards, both burlesqued; while from the tall story
of the former flows a stream of gold, which is being packed
into sacks for conveyance by waggon into the country&mdash;there
to be distributed for the purposes of bribery&mdash;to
strengthen the party already in power, known as the Old
Interest (their own). The way this is to come about is
shown in the lower compartment of the painted cloth:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
“Punch, candidate for Guzzledown,” the <i>farceur</i>, with his
protuberant rotundity of back and corporation, has a
wheel-barrow before him, filled with bags of money,
marked &pound;7000 and &pound;9000, and in all amounting to a
considerable sum; he is casting about the broad-pieces
in a shower from a ladle, and they are caught in the hats
of expectant electors.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“See from the Treasury flows the gold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">’Tis all your own&mdash;a waggon-load.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye party fools, ye courtier tribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gain no vote without a bribe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Observe how much bewitch’d you are.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The candidate is treating all around, within the inn,
as seen in the bar-parlour, his followers are feeding
gluttonously; in the balcony above are two fair nymphs,
whose favour he is conciliating by purchasing trinkets
from a Jew pedlar. A farmer voter of some influence,
probably a squire of the Tony Lumpkin order, who has
ridden into Guzzledown, is making the most of his opportunities:
the landlords of the rival inns are ostensibly
pressing him to accept invitations to dinner at the respective
head-quarters; the host of the Royal Oak is
pouring a shower of silver into the receptive palm held
out by the wary elector, while the other hand receives
the broad golden retainer of “The Crown.” The landlady
has a lapful of money, while one of George’s grenadiers
(like those seen in “The March to Finchley”) is
slyly watching the reckoning of the plunder, probably with
an eye to spoliation on his own account. The Crown,
which is also the Excise Office, is the scene of an animated
contest, rival bludgeon-men are in fierce conflict at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
doorway, furniture and stones are being thrown about, and
a man from the window is discharging a gun into the thick
of the fray below&mdash;an allusion to a murderous episode which
really occurred. The sign of the Crown, suspended to
a huge beam, is in process of removal; a man above, on the
wrong side of the support, is sawing it through, while
confederates below are dragging it down by force: this is
also figurative&mdash;the man above, who is assisting to demolish
the Crown, will come down simultaneously, while those
beneath it will be crushed by its fall. At a third house is
the sign of the Porto Bello, at the side door of which is
seen a barber demonstrating with pieces of tobacco-pipe
the manner in which Porto Bello was itself taken with six
ships only; his companion, a cobbler, has given up work,
having received sufficient money from the elections to afford
to forego toil for the present.</p>

<p>The view of the Polling Booth is full of intention.
Within, seated at the back, on a raised platform, are the
sheriffs or bailiffs with whom the election rests, and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
attendant, the beadle; in the front are the poll clerks, with
their register-books, and the lawyers to see the testaments
duly offered for attesting the oath; in the left corner, a
veteran (the Militia Bill peeps out of his pocket), who
has lost both arms and one leg, is touching the testament
with the iron hook which does duty for his missing hand;
the clerk is trying to stifle his laughter, while the opposition
lawyer is energetically protesting against this proceeding
as informal. Hogarth has literally brought “the blind
and the halt” to the hustings; in fact, as was too
frequently witnessed on these occasions, he has introduced
the extremes to which recourse was had,&mdash;a pitiable idiot, in
a hopeless stage of imbecility, is brought up to the poll in
a chair; this poor creature’s mind is too far gone to distinguish
between his right and left hands; the clerk is
vainly endeavouring to get the proper attestation, while the
keeper, or mad doctor, Dr. Shebbeare,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> whose legs are
adorned with fetters as a felon, is prompting his charge; a
political letter of the doctor’s is shown in his pocket.
Another victim, evidently on the verge of dissolution, is
smuggled up to the booth in an unconscious state, wrapped
in a blanket and carried by two repulsive ruffians; one of
them is puffing a blast of tobacco smoke full in the face
of the dying man, to whose night-cap is pinned a “True
Blue” favour.</p>

<p class="noindent">Drinking is still proceeding, and “dying speeches” are
hawked about, with the usual heading of a rude woodcut of
the gallows, in allusion most probably to a local occurrence
which produced considerable agitation amongst the public
at large&mdash;the passions of the multitude having been set
into a flame, in the absence of political excitement, by the
trial and execution at Oxford, in 1753, of a young woman,
Mary Blandy, for poisoning her father under rather
romantic circumstances; she persisted in asserting her
innocence, even on the scaffold; a number of pamphlets
were published upon her case, which became the subject of
warm dispute.</p>

<p>All these “Election” plates are rich in suggestive
allusions, the meaning of many of which are now lost.
Hogarth in his third plate has indulged in simple allegory.
Britannia’s state coach is in difficulties, to which, by the
aid of the check-string fastened to her coachman’s arm,
she is vainly endeavouring to draw the attention of her
driver, who has laid down his reins, being otherwise
engaged; the two servants on the box are absorbed in a
game of cards, while one is cheating,&mdash;an allusion to the
extravagant gambling propensities which, to so large and
notorious an extent, disfigured society in general, and
particularly (at this time) those charged with the interests
of the kingdom.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OXFORDSHIRE ELECTION.&mdash;CHAIRING THE MEMBERS. BY W. HOGARTH. 1754.</p>
</div>

<p>The fourth plate, “Chairing the Members,” exhibits the
last and apparently most trying episode as regards the
successful candidate; the hero of the hour&mdash;the newly
returned member, elected in the True Blue, or New
Interest&mdash;occupies a position which may have its honours,
but obviously has its perils. In place of the actually
returned members, Hogarth seems to have selected the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
figure of the intriguing manager of the Leicester House
party, Bubb Dodington (afterwards Lord Melcombe), for
the hero of the chairing scene. He is elevated only to find
himself surrounded with embarrassments: the dangers of
his chairing are lost sight of momentarily, for his pale face
is horror-stricken by being confronted with a fair lady of
fashion; she is equally affected by the rencontre, for she is
swooning away&mdash;it is presumed with apprehension&mdash;in the
arms of her maids. Over Bubb’s head flies a goose&mdash;a happy
conception, understood to be introduced as a parody of the
“Triumph of Alexander,” by Le Brun, where that grandiose
artist has suggestively made an eagle hover over the head
of his hero. In the Blue procession following the chairmen
are all the elements of an election triumph&mdash;rough
music of marrow-bones and cleavers, True Blue flags,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
plenty of bludgeon-men, while a “block head,” wearing the
buff favour of their opponents, is carried to ridicule the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
opposition. Another humorous episode is shown in a
vixenish dame sporting a buff cockade; she has boldly broken
through the ranks of the Blues, and is driving from their
midst her husband, a tailor, detected in his duplicity by
the virago, who is soundly cuffing her crestfallen “inferior
moiety,” lately deserted to the enemy. A barrel of beer
has been placed in the street for public use; a pewter
measure stands beside it; the mob seems to have used the
opportunity, as a would-be drinker is discovering that the
cask is already emptied. In the distance, a second chaired
member is skilfully indicated, of whom the shadow only
is seen, projected on a wall, while he is carried along to
the evident risk of limb and life, as his gesticulations imply.
Among other accessories may be noted a tar-barrel, in preparation
for a bonfire later on. The sun-dial bears the date
1755 (when the picture was completed), and marks three
o’clock, the quality dinner-hour. The bigwigs of the Court
party are assembled at an adjacent mansion, at which a
plentiful banquet is about to be served: a French <i>chef</i>, his
long clubbed tail bound with an orange favour, a female
cook, noblemen’s servants, and other retainers, all wearing
the colours of the Old Interest, are carrying the silver-covered
dishes in procession. The ministerial adherents
are assembled on the first floor; a large handsome window&mdash;all
the panes of which have been broken by the stones
of the patriots, affords a good view of the guests; from
the side window they are catching the prospect of the
Blue demonstration, surveying with malicious delight the
perilous situation of the alarmed chaired member, whose
triumph seems, for the time being, the reverse of enviable.</p>

<p>It is said the figure of the chief personage is intended
for that of the Duke of Newcastle; the Duke of Marlborough
was also actively engaged on the Tory side: while the back
of another, wearing a broad ribbon, is possibly meant for
Lord Winchilsea. Among the artist’s fugitive sketches,
as published at his widow’s, Leicester Fields, in 1781, are
the two caricatures&mdash;engraved by Bartolozzi, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Earl of Exeter’s collection of Hogarth’s originals&mdash;representing
Bubb Dodington (very like “Punch”), and the
back view of Lord Winchilsea; both these studies might
have been made for the plate of “Chairing the Members.”
These figures are also included in a caricature entitled
“The Recruiting Sergeant” 1757 (the design of which
was ascribed to the Hon. George Townshend), while that
of Lord Winchilsea, who was at the head of the admiralty,
is reproduced with scarcely any alteration, excepting the
position of the paddle shown over his shoulder, in the
“Triumph of Neptune.”</p>

EARL OF WINCHILSEA. BY HOGARTH. 1753.</p>
</div>

<p>Other multifarious incidents are given in the fourth
plate of the “Election.” A soldier with the Buff colours is
washing the wound received on behalf of his employers;
his sword is snapped across the blade. A pig-driver,
flourishing a formidable flail, is doing battle with a bear-leader,
who is armed with a bludgeon. The backward
swing of the flail is imperilling the security of the new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
member’s seat, while wounding the chair-bearers. Bruin
is helping himself from the offal pail of a passing ass&mdash;the
patient animal stopping to munch a thistle by the wayside;
the driver is belabouring the bear over the head, to the
alarm of a monkey equipped <i>&agrave; la militaire</i> and riding on the
brute’s shoulder. In the monkey’s fright, a musket at his
side is discharged in the face of a little chimney-sweep,
who, raised aloft on the wall, is stooping forward to ornament
a sculptured skull or effigy of death, placed above the
church gate, with a pair of huge round spectacles, in imitation
of those worn by Lord Winchilsea. This burning of
powder, like the other episodes, has its significance; for,
according to the account of Nichols, who claims to have
discussed the hidden meanings of these pictures with
Hogarth himself, it was “during the contested Oxfordshire
Election in 1754 an outrageous mob in the ‘Old Interest’
had surrounded a post-chaise, and were about to throw it
into the river (occupant and all), when Captain T&mdash;&mdash;,
withinside, shot a chimney-sweeper who was most active
in the assault. The captain was tried and acquitted.”
Among the items in these election bills it will be observed
that more or less mortality has generally to be reckoned,
“death by misadventure” having been sufficiently prominent
in most contests of the kind during the turbulent
times of the past. Private property was held in small
respect while rioting was rife; for instance, Hogarth has,
in the scene of the chairing, shown a mansion partially
demolished, intending to imply that the house had been
wrecked by the riotous mob in the course of their eccentric
diversions: it will be noted that the wilful destruction of
houses and furniture was another recognized feature of
election times.</p>

<p>The diary of George Bubb Dodington, Baron of Melcombe-Regis,
does not, it is true, contain any enlightenment
upon the subject of the Oxfordshire election as
depicted by Hogarth, yet the writer is circumstantial in
his account of the elections of April, 1754. The records,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
however, deal with other contests in which the diarist was
active, and notably one which brought Dodington much perplexity
of mind and loss of cash. The accounts are nearly
all set down as recitals of long interviews with the
Duke of Newcastle, who was then trying to strengthen his
hands by giving away places to those whose allegiance
was doubtful; while Dodington, upon whose influence
and assistance he could reckon, reaped nothing but mortification,
being in fact an intriguer who was for once played
upon for ends other than his own by a more astute
and less scrupulous diplomatist than himself. The heads
of the alliance are set down as under discussion. Bubb
was to furnish his interest towards the electing the new
parliament (the dissolution was then an affair of hours),
claiming to return six members on his own account.
“I did it,” he writes, “in the county of Dorset, as far
as they pleased to push it. I engaged also specifically
to choose two members for Weymouth, which he desired
might be the son of the Duke of Devonshire and Mr. Ellis
of the admiralty.” The candidates nominated by the Duke
of Newcastle, Lord J. Cavendish and Mr. Ellis, were successfully
returned by Dodington’s influence in the sequel.
Further, there was opposition in Bridgwater, where Bubb
was expected to return two members. Lord Egmont was
putting up for that place against the Court, and it was
the royal pleasure that Dodington should sacrifice himself
to keep the Tory candidate out, as signified through
Pelham; to which Bubb replied, “that I desired him,
when next these matters came to be discussed, to lay me
at the King’s feet, and tell him that, as I found it would
be agreeable to his Majesty, I would spare neither pains
nor expense to exclude him; and thus it became my engagement
to do it if I can.” “Lord Egmont’s successful
return,” he writes, “need not affect my election, though
it might destroy the Whig interest in Bridgwater for
ever.” Poor Bubb, oblivious of the royal antipathies to
the friends of the Prince of Wales, was hoping to secure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
his old post of treasurer of the navy, but the leadership of the
House of Commons had fallen upon the Pelhams, and, as
the party must be strengthened there, it was hinted that
the Duke of Newcastle would have to buy supporters by
giving away to waverers the offices which rightly were due to
his friends; to which Dodington replied without sophistication,
“that he considered himself as useful there as his
neighbours, and, considering his age, rank, the offices he
had held,” and, “adding to that, choosing six members
for them at my own expense, without the expense of one
shilling from their side, I thought the world in general,
and even the gentlemen themselves, could not expect that
their pretensions should give me the exclusion.” The duke
remarked that “the ease and cheapness of the election
of Weymouth had surprised him, that they had nothing
like it;” and Bubb considered again “that there were few
who could give his Majesty six members for nothing.”
Newcastle then took the stout future Baron Melcombe in
his arms and kissed him twice (!) “with strong assurance
of affection and service;” moreover, notes of all Bubb had
said were written out for the king’s pleasure. A week later,
Dodington sets down, “Dined at Lord Barrington’s, and
found that, notwithstanding the fine conversation of last
Thursday, all the employments are given away.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he valorously went to work to try and
return two members for Bridgwater, though rather against
his inclinations; unfortunately, although the doings of
each day are set down, the details of the election have been
abbreviated by the editor of the diary, Henry Wyndham.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“1754. April 8th. Arrived at Eastbury.</p>

<p>“11. Dr. Sharpe and I set out from Eastbury at four o’clock in the
morning for Bridgwater, where, as I expected, I found things very
disagreeably framed.</p>

<p>“12. Lord Egmont came, with trumpets, noise, etc.</p>

<p>“13. He and we walked the town: we found nothing unexpected
as far as we went.</p>

<p>“14, 15, 16. Spent in the infamous and disagreeable compliance with
the low habits of venal wretches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>“17. Came on the election, which I lost by the injustice of the
Returning Officer. The numbers were&mdash;for Lord Egmont 119, for
Mr. Balch 114, for me 105. Of my good votes 15 were rejected: 8
bad votes for Lord Egmont were received.</p>

<p>“18. Left Bridgwater for ever. Arrived at Eastbury in the evening.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Altogether Dodington places his expenses at &pound;2500, later
on at &pound;3400, and finally, when the king had thrown him
over, at nearly &pound;4000 spent in this affair. According to
an accepted political axiom, what a man buys he may
sell; Pelham admitted to Dodington that he possessed
“a good deal of marketable ware (parliamentary interest),
and that if I would empower him to offer it all to the
king, without conditions, he would he answerable to bring
the affair to a good account.” In this instance the vendor
sold himself for “just nothing at all,” as is shown in the
diary. The king disliked Bubb as the adviser of his
son, whom he hated.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“April 26. I went to the Duke of Newcastle’s. Received with
much seeming affection: thanks for Weymouth, where I had succeeded;
sorrow for Bridgwater, where I had not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I began by telling him that I had done all that was in the power
of money and labour, and showed him two bills for money remitted
thither, before I went down, one of &pound;1000, one of &pound;500, besides all
the money then in my steward’s hands, so that the election would
cost me about &pound;2500. In the next place, if this election stood, the
borough was for ever in Tory hands; that all this was occasioned by
want of proper support from the Court, and from the behaviour of the
servants of the Crown.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The truth was that the Court had really defeated
Dodington. Lord Poulett, a lord of the bedchamber, “had
acted openly against him with all his might;” and this
action on the part of the higher powers had carried the
Government employees, so that “five out of the Custom-house
officers gave single votes for Lord Egmont.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The next head was&mdash;that, in spite of all, I had a fair majority
of legal votes, for that the Mayor had admitted eight bad votes for
Lord Egmont, and refused fifteen good ones for me; so that it was
entirely in their own hands to retrieve the borough, and get rid of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
troublesome opponent, if they pleased; that if the king required this
piece of service, it was to be done, and the borough put into Whig
hands, and under his influence, without any stretch of power.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The intricacies of electioneering are supplanted by those
of statecraft from this point; Bubb’s diary rehearses&mdash;spread
over four months&mdash;the reasons for and against
petitioning for a just return; but it peeps out, and therein
lies the rub&mdash;that Dodington has inflamed the Tories by
his assistance in Dorset. Now, just at this time, the Duke
of Newcastle sought to make friends with the opposition;
and it occurred to this slippery tactician that, as Dodington
had had the sole onus of trying to keep out the Tories
and failed, if he allowed Lord Egmont to retain his
seat for Bridgwater, it would purchase his allegiance
without the cost and inconvenience of putting some post
or piece of state preferment at his disposal. Thus did
Dodington sacrifice both his money and pains without
conciliating the favour of the king, with whom the ambitious
courtier was the reverse of popular.</p>

<p>One important feature of electioneering, missing in the
later days, was the edifying practice of “Burning a Prime
Minister,” making effigies of unpopular candidates and
obnoxious ministers for burnt-offerings.</p>

<p>A caricature appeared in 1756 representing a street,
in the precincts of Westminster it is presumed, filled with
a crowd of enthusiastic patriots on their way to make a
bonfire of the offending minister in effigy. The figure
wears a cocked hat, and has a wig and mask, evidently
copied from those of the living prototype, mounted on a
stick; the coat and gloves are stuffed; the legs are sticks,
bound up into a rude resemblance to stockings and shoes.
The effigy is strapped on horseback. At the rear is a gibbet,
on which the dummy premier is to be finally suspended.
One of the mob bears a supply of faggots. Beneath this
pictorial satire, which is executed something in the style
of Sayer, the caricaturist of a later date, appear the
verses:&mdash;

<p>The following manifesto explains the object of this
publication, an appeal “Against Corruption,” and directed
to securing the purity of elections against Ministerial
bribery. The subject of the squib was evidently suggested
by the Guy Fawkes processions of November. It appeared
at the time when the Newcastle and Fox administration
was near its fall and after those expensive elections in
which the duke had spent enormous sums in bribery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Who can call to remembrance without abhorrence the behaviour
of a Whiggish Ministry, who, neglecting everything else but the
business of Bribery and Corruption, reduced the credit of the Nation
and themselves to so low an ebb, that at length they were obliged to
import Hessian and Hanoverian Troops to support an immense unconstitutional
standing army, in defending them and their measures at
home; whilst our perfidious enemies ravaged and distressed our
wretched Colonies in every other part of the globe. Now it would
be well for England if the several Tory or motley administrations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
since that time could demonstrate that they have spent less time and
treasure in the same destructive employment. As a tree is known by
its fruit, so is a bad minister by his attempting to influence Electors,
or even to gain a Majority of the Elected by any other means than the
justice of his measures; otherwise the use of a national Council is
superseded; and when a King is thus deprived of the disinterested
deliberations of his people in Parliament, the authors of the undue
influence are certainly guilty of Treason in the strictest sense of the
word.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="medium">JOHN WILKES AS A POPULAR REPRESENTATIVE.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">In the whole history of electioneering no figure is more
conspicuous than that of John Wilkes, the quondam patriot,
who was by the attacks of others brought into a prominence
which neither his abilities nor character justified.</p>

<p>Hogarth commenced hostilities against Wilkes, Churchill
(<i>The North Briton</i>), and Beardmore (<i>The Monitor</i>) by
attacking their publications incidentally in that unfortunate
attempt at political satire of his, christened “The
Times,” Plate I. (1762). It will be remembered that the
figure of the artist’s patron, Lord Bute, is there glorified
as a Scotch husbandman engaged in extinguishing a
general conflagration; while a frenzied man, intended to
personify the Duke of Newcastle, is driving a wheel-barrow
filled with <i>Monitors</i> and <i>North Britons</i> against the
legs of the zealous Scot, who, unmoved, continues his
exertions to subdue the threatened ruin of the State. Pitt
and Lord Temple are further assailed&mdash;not too cleverly&mdash;in
this view of the “Times.” On this provocation, Wilkes
and Churchill naturally took up the cudgels in their own
defence, and certainly gave Hogarth cause for irritation.
He prepared the second plate of “The Times,” with a
further pictorial castigation of his now-declared adversaries,
but was induced to reconsider the policy of publishing the
plate, and thus giving greater offence; consequently it was
not until thirty years later, when the quarrel was almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
forgotten, and the opponents had long been at rest,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> that
the world was favoured with a view of this equally laboured
satire, when it was published by the Boydells at their Shakespeare
Gallery, with the collected works of W. Hogarth
(May 29, 1790). George III., Bute, Temple, Lord Mansfield,
and others, are introduced in this version, but the
portion which is pointed at Wilkes, in continuation of this
“rough bout of clever men clumsily throwing dirt at each
other,” as it has been described, is the figurement of Miss
Fanny, of “Cock-lane ghost” notoriety, pilloried and held
up to infamy side by side with Wilkes, whose offence is
indicated as “Defamation.” On his breast is pinned a
copy of the <i>North Briton</i>, the No. 17 which was specially
devoted to a base attack upon Hogarth. This incendiary
publication is already threatened with flames from the
penitential candle held by “Miss Fanny,” his shrouded
companion in disgrace. Indignities are showered upon
Wilkes in allusion to his involved circumstances; his empty
pockets are turned inside out, a school-boy is watering his
legs, a woman is trundling a mop over his head, and he is
generally regarded with derisive contempt by the crowd.</p>

<p>The crowning effort of Hogarth’s revenge for the abuse
showered upon him by both Wilkes and Churchill was the
famous etching in which the popular favourite is pilloried
to all time as the type and very personification of everything
false and sinister, and yet most lifelike as to resemblance;
for Wilkes was himself so cynically candid as to
admit in after-life that he was “growing more like his
portrait every day.” The famous likeness represents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Wilkes seated in a chair at a low table, on which is an
inkstand and the <i>North Briton</i>, Nos. 17 and 45; he is
holding the staff, topped with an inverted vessel to simulate
the cap of liberty. Attitude and
features are alike expressive, and,
as Mr. Stephens has described it,
“he leers and squints as if in
mockery of his own pretences to
patriotism.” When brought up
from the Tower, to which Lord
Bute’s party had ventured to commit
him for the attack in the <i>North
Briton</i>, No. 45, Wilkes was tried at
Westminster, before Chief Justice
Pratt&mdash;subsequently eulogized as
“the champion of Freedom and Justice,” and better known
to fame as Lord Camden,&mdash;who caused the prisoner to be
discharged, to the frantic delight of the populace. It
was on this occasion that Hogarth secured his opportunity
of sketching the idol of the people and the thorn of
the Court. In a note prefixed to “An Epistle to William
Hogarth,” by Churchill, it is averred that when Mr. Wilkes
was the second time brought from the Tower to Westminster
Hall, Hogarth skulked behind a screen in the corner of the
gallery of the Common Pleas; and while Lord Chief Justice
Pratt was enforcing the great principles of the Constitution,
the painter was employed in caricaturing the prisoner. So
popular was this print, issued at one shilling, that Nichols
mentions “nearly four thousand copies were worked off in
a few weeks.” “The Epistle” referred to was provoked
by the etching of John Wilkes, “Drawn from the Life.”
Hogarth is said to have felt severely the retort which the
vigorous and “bruising” Churchill thought proper to
make.</p>

<p class="caption">A BEAR-LEADER. HOGARTH, CHURCHHILL,
AND WILKES.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This plate was issued at 1<i>s.</i> <i>6d.</i>, and seems to have gone
through various alterations and additions from first to last.
On the palette which first displayed the mystifying “line
of beauty,” was substituted two designs of a figurative
nature&mdash;the one having reference to Pitt, his resignation
and annual pension, and his city supporters, represented by
the emblematic civic guardians, Gog and Magog; the other
a group further applying to the castigation of the designer’s
foes. Hogarth is armed with
a triple whip, with which he
is lustily chastising a big
dancing bear, Churchill, held
bound and muzzled, as not
only the artist but the ministry
and the Scotch faction would
have rejoiced to have effected;
the Bruiser to the clerical
ruffles and bands has incongruously
added the modish laced hat of a man about town;
the other end of the rope, by which Hogarth has secured
the bear through the muzzle, is fastened round an ape,
intended to personify Wilkes. This animal is wearing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
wig exactly similar to that shown on Wilkes’s head in the
too-famous etching; the <i>North Briton</i> is in his left hand;
the spear, topped with the inevitable cap of liberty, is
turned into a hobby-horse, to infer, according to Mr. F. G.
Stephen’s account, “that Wilkes used Liberty to get his
own ends, which not more than a child progresses on its
‘cock-horse’ did he really obtain.” The face of the
fiddling personage, who is making the music for this pretty
caper, is a featureless blank; he wears a ribbon of knighthood,
and it is understood that Earl Temple is the person
intended.</p>

<p>Other uncomplimentary allusions to Wilkes and his
proceedings appear in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, where is a
woodcut of an execution, I.W., and M.P., with a “Toast”&mdash;“May
loyalists walk easily in their Boots [a reference to
Lord Bute], and malcontents die like Wilks in their shells.”</p>

<p>The notoriety of John Wilkes was much assisted by the
ill-advised and clumsy conduct of the ministry, which
elected to make a martyr of the man whose career proves
him to have been but a sham patriot, and, who, if unnoticed,
was totally without weight or consequence. On April 30,
1763, Wilkes found himself, in spite of the Habeas Corpus
granted by the Common Pleas, conducted to the Tower on
a warrant, signed by the Earls of Egremont and Halifax
as Privy Councillors and Secretaries of State, authorizing
the Constable of the Tower, the Right Hon. John Lord
Berkeley of Stratton,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“to receive into your custody the body of John Wilkes, Esq., herewith
sent you, for being the author and publisher of a most infamous and
seditious libel, entitled the <i>North Briton</i>, No. XLV., tending to
inflame the minds and alienate the affections of the people from His
Majesty, and to excite them to traitorous insurrections against the
Government.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The small engraving which exhibits Wilkes in the Tower,
forms one portion of a series, entitled “The Places” (being

<p>In the version of “Daniel cast into the Den of Lions;
or, <i>True Blue</i> will never stain” (April 29, 1763), Wilkes
is shown the centre of a highly elaborate allegorical combination,
which deals with the incidents of his arrest,
associated with the <i>North Briton</i>, and his obnoxious
writings. One of the scenes exhibits the king’s messengers
violently breaking into Wilkes’s house, Great George Street,
Westminster, and ransacking his receptacles for papers.
On the other side, the messengers are shown conducting
Wilkes to the Tower, the title “Den of Lions” not being
wide of the mark, since it, at that time, was the abiding
place of the royal menagerie. Wilkes is made to declare:
“Corruption I detest, and Persecution I despise,”&mdash;sentiments
befitting the patriotic martyr, as he was then believed
to be, a “goodly repute” with which he was only too desirous
of parting in exchange for such bribes as were
weighty enough for his acceptance. In the symbolic view
of this new “Daniel,” the goddess Fame hovers over her
whilom favourite, with a wreath to crown his brow; she is
publishing, through her trumpet, “Magnus est Veritas;”
the door of the den which confines the lions is a prominent
feature. Below appears the Lieutenant of the Tower; he
has a written “counsel’s opinion” in his hand, and is
replying to a demand for admittance made by Wilkes’s
brother, “Consider, sir, my Lord Temple was not suffered
to see him.” When Wilkes was committed to the Tower,
both his brother and Earl Temple applied to be admitted
to see him, and were refused.</p>

<p>The “general warrant” on which Wilkes was arrested
was proved illegal, and on a writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, he was
set at liberty on the ground of his privilege as a member
of Parliament. After his release from the Tower, Wilkes
was involved in a duel, and severely wounded; he then fled
to Paris, January, 1764, and was, in his absence, expelled
from parliament and outlawed for contempt of court. On
the issue of writs for the general election, after the dissolution
of parliament, March 12, 1768, Wilkes, who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
made several vain attempts to get the sentence reversed,
suddenly presented himself as a candidate to represent the
city of London, in the interval addressing to the king a
submissive letter imploring pardon and the reversal of the
sentence of outlawry which had been passed upon him.
This petition the king rejected with decision. Although
Alderman Sir William Baker was the only citizen of note
or influence who supported him, Wilkes persisted in his
candidature, the lower people embracing his cause with
ardour; but he polled the minimum of votes, and was
signally defeated, the successful members being the Hon.
Thomas Harley, lord mayor, with 3,729 votes; Sir R.
Ladbroke, 3,678; William Beckford, 3,402; Barlow Trecothwick,
2,957. The unsuccessful candidates were Sir Richard
Glyn, 2,823; John Patterson, 1,769; and Wilkes, at the
bottom of the poll, who contrived to secure 1,247 votes.</p>

<p>On Wilkes’s return from the Guildhall at the close of the
poll, March 23, 1768, where, as seen, he obtained the lowest
number of votes, the people displayed their fervour for
spurious patriotism by removing the horses from his carriage,
and drawing it themselves; other extravagancies of a like
nature showed the spirit of the multitude, by whom Wilkes
was regarded as the tribune of the people, a situation very
much to his taste. Considering his mob-popularity assured,
he now proposed to conciliate his opponents; the first step
was to make a pretence of submission. On the 22nd of
March, he wrote to the solicitor of the treasury: “I take the
liberty of acquainting you, that in the beginning of the
ensuing term I shall present myself to the court of King’s
Bench. I pledge my honour as a gentleman, that on the very
first day I will there make my personal appearance.” The
letter sent by Wilkes to the king was certainly a plausible
composition, but the fervid assurances there given being in
direct antagonism with the conduct of the writer at that
very time, it may be held that George III. was justified in
treating the applicant with indignant contempt.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>“I beg thus to throw myself at your Majesty’s feet, and
supplicate the mercy and clemency which shine with such lustre among
your princely virtues. Some former ministers, whom your Majesty,
in condescension to the wishes of your people, thought proper to remove,
employed every wicked and deceitful act to oppress your subject, and
to avenge their own personal cause on him, whom they imagined to be
the principal author of bringing to public view their ignorance, insufficiency,
and treachery to your Majesty and the nation.</p>

<p>“I have been the innocent and unhappy victim of revenge. I was
forced by their injustice and violence into exile, which I have never
ceased to consider, for many years, as the most cruel oppression;
because I could not longer be under the benign influence of your
Majesty in this land of liberty.</p>

<p>“With a heart full of zeal for the service of your Majesty and my
country, I implore, Sire, your clemency. My only hopes of pardon
are founded in the great goodness and benevolence of your Majesty;
and every day of freedom you may be graciously pleased to permit me
the enjoyment of, in my dear native land, shall give proofs of my zeal
and attachment to your service.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter was judiciously ignored, but meanwhile fresh
publicity was awaiting Wilkes&mdash;on the 27th, he was carried
by a writ of <i>capias ut legatum</i> to the King’s Bench.</p>

<p>The return of Wilkes from Paris, his failure for the city,
and election for Middlesex are figuratively shadowed forth
in “The Flight of Liberty,” a broadside consisting of two
engraved designs, “The Return of Liberty,” and “Liberty
Revived,” with verses in praise of Wilkes and reflecting
adversely upon his antagonists. In the upper compartment
is shown the Court, or administrative faction, destroying
the Temple of Liberty (an allusion to Earl Temple), raised
above the statue of Wilkes, with the cap of liberty, as usual,
elevated on the staff of maintenance. Lord Bute trampling
on Magna Charta, is foremost of the destroyers who are
wrecking the whole edifice, the very foundations of which
are being razed; the “Laird of Boot” is exclaiming, “Well
said, guid friends, down with the mighty <i>Temple</i>,” in
allusion to the protection and patronage that nobleman
had already extended to Wilkes; the Duke of Bedford, Lord
North, and other ministers are aiding. The second design
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
shows “the Temple of Liberty built by John Wilkes, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1762,” reinstated, “never to fall again.”</p>

<p>Nothing daunted by his defeat for the city of London,
Wilkes at once offered himself for the county of Middlesex.
In his “Memoirs of the Reign of George III.,” Walpole
gives certain glimpses of the election proceedings, which
are as descriptive as a more detailed account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“On the 23rd of March the Election began at Brentford; and while
the irresolution of the Court and the carelessness of the Prime Minister,
Grafton, caused a neglect of all precautions, the zeal of the populace
had heated itself to a pitch of fury.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The other candidates were Sir W. Beauchamp Proctor and
Mr. Cooke, the former members. Cooke, who had sat from
1750, was confined with the gout; a relation, who appeared
for him, was roughly handled. Amidst the wrecking of
carriages which ensued, that of Proctor did not escape the
attention of the roughs; it “was demolished by the mob.”</p>

<p>The coach-glasses of such as did not huzza for “Wilkes”
and “Liberty” were broken, the paint and varnish of
chariots and coaches, met and stopped for miles round,
were spoiled by the mob&mdash;scratching them with the favourite
“45.” Lord Bute, generally the object of popular disfavour,
was denounced by an attack made on his residence, where
the mob broke his windows, as usual, but failed to effect an
entrance; the same unwelcome attention was paid to Lord
Egremont’s, in Pall Mall, as the chief signatory to the warrant
for Wilkes’s committal. The Duke of Northumberland
had the honour of appearing, whether he would or no, of
being forced to supply the mob with liquor, and to drink
with them to Wilkes’s success. The demonstration assumed
formidable proportions; all the windows from West to East
were illuminated to please the mob, otherwise they were
broken by the riotous “true loyal Britons and friends
of Liberty,” who performed some curious feats; some of
the regimental drummers, not the Scotch regiments it may
be premised, beating their drums for Wilkes. This astute
diplomatist, finding his election secure, very prudently dismissed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
his enthusiastic partisans, such as the weavers,
back to town, the polling<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> was ended, and by the next
morning quietude was resumed in the vicinity of Brentford.
Some of the incidents were particularly ludicrous, the mob
going out of the way to perpetuate the number of the
<i>North Briton</i> so objectionable to the Court. The Austrian
Ambassador, the Count de Seilern, described by Horace
Walpole in a letter to the Earl of Hertford as the most
stately and ceremonious of men, was obliged to get out of
his coach, and ignominiously held with his legs in the air
while the figures “45” were chalked on the soles of his shoes.
This insult formed the grounds of an official complaint. It
was as difficult for the minister to help laughing at the
gravity of his representations as to redress the slight
offered to a friendly power in the person of its representative.</p>

<p>Wilkes was now master of the situation; all his expectations
were verified. Elated with success, his audacity enabled
him to make the most of his undeserved triumph, and
assuming a tone which heaped fresh mortifications upon
the Court, he printed an address of acknowledgment to his
constituents, in which he invited them to give him their
instructions from time to time, and promised that he would
always defend their civic and religious rights. Although
posing as the champion of liberty, Wilkes’s parliamentary
career was a dismal failure; in the House he was of no
account whatever.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note contemporaneous opinion on a
point which is so strongly distorted by partisanship that
independent impressions are rare. Dr. Franklin, whose
genuine passion for liberty it must be admitted was as
absorbing and unaffected as Wilkes’s assumed patriotism
was shallow and self-serving, happened to be in London
at the time of the violent ferment occasioned by the
Middlesex election in 1768. Although lately returned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
from Paris, and himself, a citizen of the land which complimented
Paine, he thus unreservedly sums up the popular
candidate, together with the political agitation associated
with his pretensions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“’Tis really an extraordinary event to see an outlaw and exile of
bad personal character, not worth a farthing, come over from France,
set himself up as a candidate for the capital of the kingdom, miss his
election only by being too late in his application, and immediately
carrying it for the principal county. The mob, spirited up by numbers
of different ballads, sung or roared in the streets, requiring gentlemen
and ladies of all ranks as they passed in their carriages, to shout for
‘Wilkes and Liberty;’ marking the same words on their coaches with
chalk, and ‘No. 45’ on every door, which extend a vast way along the
roads into the country. I went last week to Winchester, and observed
that for fifteen miles out of town there was scarcely a door or window-shutter
next the road unmarked, and this continued here and there
quite to Winchester, which is sixty-four miles.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The day of Wilkes’s election appeared the portrait of
“John Wilkes, elected Knight of the Shire for Middlesex,
March 28, 1768, by the free voice of the people,” with,
according to the allegorical taste of the time, Hercules
and Minerva as supporters, the latter crowning the elect
M.P. with a wreath, while the former tramples upon the
serpent of Envy; the genius of Liberty is holding the staff
of maintenance, surmounted by the cap of liberty (as invariably
associated with Wilkes), and is pointing to the
portrait as her champion. Simultaneously appeared an
engraving commemorative of other incidents of the return
from Brentford, showing the valour of the chief magistrate
of the city. The guards on duty at St. James’s
Palace had orders to be in readiness to march at beat of
drum to suppress any riots which might take place; it has
been described how certain drummers took to drumming
for Wilkes, while his sympathizers marched through Westminster
to the city, upsetting all in their way, chalking
doors, breaking window-glass, both in houses and carriages,
inscribing vehicles and foot-passengers impartially with
“45.” “Wilkes and Liberty” was the cry, and woe to those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
who did not join in shouting, for they, without further
inquiry, were promptly knocked down. In the city, the
mob grew more outrageous, the lord mayor being the Hon.
Thomas Harley, who had been elected for the city, at the
top of the poll, when Wilkes, his name lowest on the list,
had been defeated ignominiously; moreover, the lord mayor
was a courtier, and was denounced subsequently in the
<i>North Briton</i> as “a political gambler,” nor was the charge
groundless. The mob accordingly attacked the Mansion
House and the lord mayor’s private residence in Aldersgate
Street; neither of these places being illuminated in
honour of Wilkes was a sufficient offence in the sight of
the mob, who proceeded to demolish the windows: every
pane of glass was broken, even to those of the lady
mayoress’s bed-chamber. Then they erected a gallows,
on which was suspended a boot and petticoat to symbolize
the Princess of Wales, only too well-known, according to
popular clamour, in association with the Earl of Bute, the
“Laird of the Boot” thus indicated in close proximity;
these suggestive emblems of hated “secret influence” were
also marked “45” for the nonce. The pictorial satire
evoked on this topic, “The Rape of the Petticoat” (March
28, 1768), exhibits the lord mayor making a sally from the
Mansion House, supported by constables armed with long
staves; the chief magistrate has himself seized the obnoxious
boot and petticoat, amid the ridicule and laughing
resistance of the rabble, who are treating his lordship to
indignities. Below the design is inscribed, “He valiantly
seiz’d the Petticoat and Boot at the portal of his own
Mansion.&mdash;<i>Daily Advertiser.</i>”</p>

<p>This loyal zeal was rewarded with signal favour.
Harley was made a councillor of State, and subsequently,
through Lord Suffolk, obtained a lucrative contract. To
the impression of this print in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i> the
following verses were added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div>

<p>On the 20th of April, Wilkes appeared before the Court
of King’s Bench, Westminster, of which event an engraving
was published. On his surrendering to his outlawry, the
Attorney-General moved for Wilkes’s commitment, but
the judges refused to grant an order to that effect, on the
ground that he was not legally before the court; Wilkes
then left, accompanied by the plaudits of the spectators.
“The Scot’s Triumph; or, a Peep behind the Curtain” gives
a further illustration of this subject; this print, and another
following, are announced in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To Connoisseurs.&mdash;This day is published a satirical scratch in the
style of Rembrandt, entitled The Scotch Triumph; with the representation
of their amazing exploits in St. George’s Fields; the murder of
the innocent, and the sacrifice of Liberty, by Molock; with some
curious anecdotes.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first version, Wilkes and his friends are driving
to surrender in state; their coach is about to crush a
Scotch thistle by the way; the mob have taken the horses
from the vehicle and are dragging it themselves on the road
to the Bench; Wilkes is thus addressing his vociferous
supporters&mdash;“Gentlemen and Friends, let me beg you to
desist; I’m willing to submit to the laws of my country.”</p>

<p>All the leading political personages are introduced as
spectators. Lord Holland, an alleged adviser of Lord
Bute, is observing, “We have got him safe in a trap at
last.” “Jemmy Twitcher” (Lord Sandwich) is responding,
“Yes, but I much doubt whether we shall be able to keep
him there.” On the 27th of April, Wilkes again came up for
judgment, and was then committed to the King’s Bench
Prison. On his way thither, in the custody of two tipstaffs
of Lord Mansfield, the coach was stopped by the people,
a further popular demonstration was made, the horses
were removed, and the vehicle drawn through the city by
an enthusiastic crowd, the marshal’s deputies being
invited to get out. He finally was escorted to a public-house,
the Three Tuns Tavern, in Spitalfields (or Cornhill,
according to Walpole’s account); from thence, after the
departure of his demonstrative admirers, Wilkes judged it
prudent to make his escape, and surrender himself again,
this time at the prison gates and to the marshal of the
King’s Bench. When the news of his incarceration reached
the mob there was a fresh uproar; the day following, the
prison was surrounded, the palings enclosing the footpath
were torn up and made into a bonfire, and the inhabitants
of Southwark found themselves under the necessity, either
of illuminating their houses, or of taking the consequences;
the mob dispersed on the arrival of a small guard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Sergeant Glynn was arguing before all the
judges of the Court of King’s Bench respecting the errors
of Wilkes’s outlawry; while, from his place of confinement,
Wilkes next proceeded to address his sympathizing constituents:&mdash;</p>

<h3>“TO THE GENTLEMEN, CLERGY, AND FREEHOLDERS OF
THE COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>“In support of the liberties of this country against the arbitrary
rule of ministers, I was before committed to the Tower, and am now
sentenced to this prison. Steadiness, with, I hope, strength of mind,
do not however leave me; for the same consolation follows me here,
the consciousness of innocence, of having done my duty, and exerted
all my abilities, not unsuccessfully, for this nation. I can submit
even to far greater sufferings with cheerfulness, because I see that my
countrymen reap the happy fruits of my labours and persecutions, by
the repeated decisions of our Sovereign courts of justice in favour of
liberty. I therefore bear up with fortitude, and even glory, that
I am called to suffer in this cause, because I continue to find the
noblest reward, the applause of my native country, of this great, free,
and spirited people.</p>

<p>“I chiefly regret, gentlemen, that this confinement deprives me of
the honour of thanking you in person, according to my promise; and
at present takes from me, in a great degree, the power of being useful
to you. The will, however, to do every service to my constituents
remains in its full force; and when my sufferings have a period, the
first day I regain my liberty shall restore a life of zeal in the cause
and interests of the county of Middlesex.</p>

<p>“In this prison, in any other, in every place, my ruling passion will
be the love of England and our free constitution. For those objects
I will make every sacrifice. Under all the oppressions which
ministerial rage and revenge can invent, my steady purpose is to
concert with you, and other true friends of the country, the most
probable means of rooting out the remains of arbitrary power and
Star-chamber inquisition, and of improving as well as securing the
generous plans of freedom, which were the boast of our ancestors, and
I trust will remain the noblest inheritance of our posterity, the only
genuine characteristic of Englishmen.</p>

<p class="author">
“JOHN WILKES.<br />
</p>

<p>“<i>King’s Bench Prison, May 5th, 1768.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>By this letter it will be seen that Wilkes chiefly appealed
to what is best described as clap-trap sensationalism; he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
continued, however, to be the cause of constant apprehension,
the military and other authorities taking every
precaution to preserve the peace of the metropolis.</p>

<p>While Wilkes was kept a prisoner in the King’s Bench,
the authorities made demonstrations of resorting to armed
force for the ostensible purpose of preserving the peace of
the metropolis, and, taught precaution by the famous
“45” demonstration which followed Wilkes’s election for
Middlesex, to check further rioting with firmness, which
unfortunately degenerated into ferocity.</p>

<p>Parliament met on the 10th of May, Lord Camden being
now lord chancellor. It seems the misconception had
arisen that Wilkes’s outlawry would be reversed, and that
in any case he would be suffered to attend the assembling
of parliament. With the design of conveying him thither in
triumph, a great body of people were gathered at the
King’s Bench. Finding their expectations disappointed of
seeing the idol of the hour set at large and reinstated as
“the tribune of the people,” they demanded him at the
prison, and grew very tumultuous; whereupon the Riot Act
was read by two justices of Surrey, but the mob threw
stones and brickbats while it was reading, when one of the
spectators, seeing other persons run, ran too, but was
unhappily singled out by a picket of the Scotch Guards,
who broke their ranks&mdash;a breach of military discipline&mdash;and
followed him about five hundred yards into a cowhouse,
and there shot him dead. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>“Soon after this, the crowd increasing,
an additional number of the Guards was sent for,
who marched thither, and also a party of horse grenadiers
(two regiments had, it appears, been under arms in St.
George’s Fields throughout the disturbances), when, the
riot continuing, the mob were fired on by the soldiers, and
five or six were killed on the spot, and about fifteen
wounded, among them being two women, one of whom
subsequently died of her wounds. She was, it appears,
trying to move her oranges out of danger. Another
account says (<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>) several of the people

killed were passing along the road at a distance; and, later
on, it is said not one of the persons actually concerned in
the rioting were hurt by the firing. Several versions of
the fatal affair appeared immediately. The case of the
inoffensive youth who was thus barbarously slaughtered
excited general sympathy; his name was William Allen,
and his father was master of the Horseshoe Inn and
Livery Stables, Blackman Street, Southwark. On the
Scotch faction was heaped all the opprobrium of this
regretable transaction.”</p>

<p>Among others, appeared the illustration of “The Scotch
Victory,” 1768; on the wall of the outhouse, to which the
lad had fled for shelter when pursued, is “’45,” an allusion
to the cruelties of the Highland raid in 1745, as well as to
the “XLV. North Briton.” Alexander Murray, the officer,
Donald Maclury, a corporal, and MacLaughlin, a grenadier,
are shown in the act of assassinating Allen. A halter
which lies near the feet of the soldiers and a sketch of
a gallows and a man hanging indicate the public sentiments
on the matter. The letterpress is to this effect:&mdash;</p>

MASSACRE OF ST. GEORGE’S FIELDS. 1768.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He begged “that they may be assured that every possible regard
shall be shown to them in return for their zeal and good conduct on
this occasion,” “and in case any disagreeable circumstance should
happen in the execution of their duty, they shall have every defence
and protection that the law authorities, and this Office (the War)
can give.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Justice Gillam, who was the first to give the order to
the third regiment of Guards to fire on the people, was
tried for the murder of Redburn, a weaver; the judges
acquitted him of all responsibility, and complimented him
on the humane manner in which he had exercised his
authority. Sergeant Glynn, Wilkes’s friend and adviser,
was for the prosecution. In the course of the evidence it
appeared that there had been assembled in St. George’s
Fields a disorderly concourse, where, after shouting
“<i>Wilkes and Liberty</i>,” they made an attack on the King’s
Bench Prison, threw stones into the marshal’s house, and
at length burst open the outward gate of the prison, to the
terror of the keepers, who not only feared for the security
of their prisoners, but imagined their own lives were
endangered; notwithstanding their apprehensions, the
keepers guarded the inner gates from the mob, so that
the rioters dispersed without effecting their purpose.</p>

<p>The marshal, anticipating another attack the day
following, applied to the magistrates for assistance, as
shown in the foregoing. On the 10th of May, a larger mob
assembled, repeating the cry of “Wilkes and Liberty;”
whereupon the magistrates began to expostulate with them.
The Riot Act was then read, and its intentions endeavoured
to be explained. The rabble hissed and hooted the soldiers,
who endeavoured to scatter them. At last, a stone struck
Justice Gillam, and he ordered the firing, though, as far as
could be proved, there existed no absolute necessity for
this extreme measure. Gillam, who was exhibited to
ridicule as “Midas, the Surrey justice,” appears to have
been most unpopular, if not altogether unfit for the responsible
position in which he was placed; “the note sent to
a bookseller by a magistrate” is attributed to this hero:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
“Sir, Send me the ax Re Latin to a Gustus of Pease.” On
his trial, James Derbyshire, a bookseller, deposed that
Mr. Gillam said publicly in the hearing of the soldiers,
“<i>that his orders from the ministry were, that some men must
be killed, and that it were better to kill five and twenty to-day
than one hundred to-morrow</i>.” According to the Rev. John
Horne (afterwards Tooke, and known to fame as the
“Brentford Parson”), who was present at the riot, it was
he who procured the warrant for the arrest of the soldiers.
The trial did not take place until the 9th of August. Witnesses
appeared against Donald Maclury, who was charged
with firing the fatal shot; it was Maclury (or M’Laury) who
said “Damn him, that’s him, shoot him.” Mr. Allen’s
ostler declared that when Allen fell, after the prisoner had
fired, Maclury said, “Damn it, it is a good shot.” On his
way to gaol, the day after the murder, it was proved
Maclury acknowledged “that what they had done was in
consequence of orders, and he hoped they should obtain
mercy.” The defence was that MacLaughlin, a grenadier,
acknowledged to Mr. Gillam and six soldiers that it was he
who shot Allen, and <i>that his piece went off by accident</i>.
He had since deserted, and, it was openly stated in the
papers, received one shilling a day to keep out of the way.
The verdict was “not guilty;” and it was admitted that, in
order to save the life of the soldier, who was liable for
murder, it had “been found necessary to suffer the prosecutors
to persist in their mistake in apprehending and
impeaching an innocent man, and in the mean time giving
the grenadier who actually fired the gun an opportunity
to escape.” Both soldiers were charged at the King’s
Bench, when, by arrangement, the guilty man was admitted
to bail, to be smuggled out of harm’s way; “the other was
remanded back to prison as the person who actually shot
the lad,” according to the proceedings, May 16, 1768.</p>

<p>Another version of the “Scotch Victory,” with the
rebus of the jack-boot standing under a petticoat, and
enclosed by Scotch thistles, forms part of a mock dedication:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
“To the Earl of (Bute), Protector of our Liberties,
this plate is humbly inscribed by F. Junius Brutus.”</p>

<p>“The Operation,” a frontispiece to the <i>Political Register</i>
for June, 1768, shows Lord Bute stabbing Britannia with
a dagger, while the ministers already mentioned in association
with the death of Allen are catching the blood which
flows from her wounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>Oxford Magazine</i> for 1769 gives an engraving of
the monument finally erected over the grave of Mr. Allen,
junior. It represents an altar tomb enclosed by iron rails:
on one side is introduced the reprobated Scotch thistle,
with the legend, “Murder screen’d and rewarded;” on the
other side is shown a Scotch soldier of the third regiment
of Foot Guards, evidently intended for the murderous
MacLaughlin, approaching and pointing to the inscription
on the tomb, exclaiming, “I have obtain’d a pension of
a shilling a day, only for putting an end to thy days!”

<span class="medium">MIDDLESEX ELECTIONS, 1768-9.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">Within a month of his return died George Cooke, the
Tory colleague of Wilkes in the representation of Middlesex,
who had sat from 1750; he was prothonotary of the Court
of Common Pleas, one of the joint paymasters of the
forces, and colonel of the Middlesex Militia. Consequent
on his decease a seat for the county was to be contested
in December, 1768, and the public were indulged with
another exciting struggle at the Brentford hustings. The
candidates were John Glynn, the friend and advocate of
Wilkes, and Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, the candidate
defeated in the previous election. The superheated
state of popular feeling had not had time to cool down;
moreover, Wilkes, the chosen of the electors, was a prisoner.
Both parties on this occasion seem to have resorted to
terrorism; mutual recriminations as to the hiring of
ruffians and bludgeon-men were made during the inquiries
into the disturbances which ensued. A view of the situation,
“Scene at the Brentford Hustings,” 1768, exhibits
the violent and brutal behaviour of mercenaries in the pay
of Proctor’s faction&mdash;chiefly reckless bullies, according to
the engraving of the Brentford election. Females are
beaten causelessly; a fruit-stall is wrecked, and a respectably
attired person is taking advantage of the confusion to help
himself from the stock, whilst the proprietress is wantonly
beaten with a heavy cudgel; the legion of bludgeons is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
enlisted in the cause of “Liberty and Proctor;” a hero
whose head is shaven, and who is evidently a professional
pugilist of the Figg and Broughton type, is made to
exclaim, “For a guinea a day; damn Glynn and all his
friends.” Other beaters&mdash;chairmen, linkmen, and the like&mdash;are
driving all before them, and carrying the hustings
by assault, demanding, “Bring down the poll-book&mdash;Proctor
shall be the man.” The scattered remnants of
a rival mob are retiring; one of these is exclaiming,
“D&mdash;&mdash; ye, you dogs&mdash;we’ll match you all presently.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE HUSTINGS AT BRENTFORD, MIDDLESEX ELECTION, 1768. SERJEANT GLYNN AND SIR W. BEAUCHAMP PROCTOR.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 178.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Oxford Magazine</i> (vol. i.) has printed the correspondence
which ensued upon the disgraceful violence and
the attack on the hustings, in which several persons were
injured and at least one fatally. The candidate ultimately
returned, John Glynn, began by addressing a “Letter to
the Freeholders of Middlesex,” pledging himself that the
blood of his constituents so wantonly shed should be
vindicated, and the charge brought home both to the hired
and the hirers&mdash;“the more exalted their stations and the
more privileged their persons, the louder is the call for
justice.” The serjeant continues, “The freedom of a
county election is the last sacred privilege we have left;
and it does not become any honest Englishman to wish
to survive it. There is virtue still left in the country; we
are come to a crisis, and the consequence of this struggle
shall determine whether we shall be Slaves or Free.”</p>

<p>Following suit, Sir W. Beauchamp Proctor also addressed
a letter to the freeholders of Middlesex, rebutting
the charges made against him. After referring to twenty
years, during which, by fair and honourable means, he had
endeavoured to obtain their esteem,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Calumniated as I have been during a long-depending canvass,
I was in hopes that every topic of defamation had been exhausted;
and I never expected that the daring and tumultuous interruption
of last Tuesday’s poll would have been ascribed to me in so illiberal
and inflammatory a style as my antagonist has thought proper to use.
For his conduct in the course of this business the serjeant appeals to
me, and I appeal to the sense of mankind, whether a <i>band of writers</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
has not been let loose to be the <i>assassins of my reputation</i>? whether
the serjeant has not, in a manner unworthy of a gentleman and a
lawyer, exerted every effort to set up <i>usage</i> in opposition to the law
of the land, and endeavoured in a dictatorial manner to compel the
sheriffs to close the poll in one day, to the prejudice of the electors,
and in violation of the authority vested in the returning officers, by
the wisdom of the legislature.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Proctor declared that he was not only struck by “the
banditti,” but in the utmost peril of his life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If a signal was given,&mdash;if <i>Proctor and Liberty</i> appeared in the
hats of the ruffians, how that might be contrived by the election arts
of my adversaries need not now be mentioned. It was the opinion
of my counsel, when a riot was artfully talked of by my opponents,
<i>above an hour</i> before it happened, that the sheriffs in that case should
resort immediately to the protection of parliament.” Finally, he
expressed hopes “to bring this dark transaction into open daylight,
and to show the world who has been the man of blood;” moreover,
the writer “has full confidence that on the last day of the poll lawless
men will not again dare to invade the rights of the freeholders.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The disavowal, which “doth protest too much” as
published by Proctor, goaded the virtuous indignation of
the friends of freedom up to fever heat, and acted like a
red rag on an infuriated bull in the instance of John
Horne (Tooke), “the Brentford parson;” he addressed a
scathing philippic to Proctor, declaring that Sir William’s
refutations “subscribed his own guilt, and that the Court
candidate had signed his name to a lie:”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I here declare in form, that you, Sir William Beauchamp Proctor,
did both hire and cause to be hired, that mob which committed the
outrages at Brentford; that mob, which immediately after the total
interruption of the poll, demanded which was the house that belonged
to the parson of Brentford; and to whose fury a neighbouring clergyman,
who heard them ask after my house, was apprehensive of falling
a sacrifice, by the mistake of a person who called himself by my name.
Boast of your humanity, Sir William, to Captain Read; that gentleman,
to save his own life, declared himself your friend. Persuade Mr.
Allen they were not your mob; that gentleman brought you to the side
of the hustings where they were, and heard them answer to his
question, and to your face, that you, Sir W. Beauchamp Proctor,
were the person that gave them orders for what they were about.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p></blockquote>

<p>As to the “band of writers,” Parson Horne frankly
avowed himself the author of most of the letters that
appeared against Proctor in the papers, and concluded
with a stinging reference to those “new-fashioned constables,”
as Sir John Fielding termed the hireling bullies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Where you endeavour to justify your proceedings by the usage
of all contested popular elections, and where you affect to consider
your hired ruffians, the Irish chairmen, as ‘assistants to the civil
magistrates.’ The business of the approaching poll prevents my
saying half what I have to tell you; but I promise you, you shall hear
from me again and again, if you will please to issue out your orders to
your ruffians to grant me a <i>Reprieve</i> till after the election.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The main features of this ill-advised attack, which,
it was believed, was intended to put an end to the election
should the polling prove adverse to the party in whose pay
the hired mob acted, are given in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Thursday, Dec. 8, 1768. This day being appointed for the
Middlesex election, the candidates appeared on the hustings at ten
minutes before nine. Notwithstanding this, the opening of the poll
was delayed till near eleven. One of the narrow avenues leading
to Brentford butts was occupied very early by a hired mob, with
bludgeons, bearing favours in their hats, inscribed, ‘Proctor and
Liberty.’ A much larger, but very compact body, armed as the former,
and with the same distinctions, were placed near the hustings, on an
eminence, and in a disposition which was evidently the arrangement
of an experienced sergeant. The rest of these banditti were stationed
in different quarters of the town, to strike a general terror into the
honest part of the freeholders; there was besides a ‘corps de reserve’
which was to sally forth on a signal given.</p>

<p>“When these dispositions were secured, a chosen party of butchers,
in the same interest, traversed the town, and insulted the hustings
with marrow-bones and cleavers. When Sir William Beauchamp
Proctor’s numbers were nearly exhausted, and the course of the
Poll declared decisively for Mr. Serjeant Glynn, who had still
great multitudes unpolled, the signal was given. An instantaneous
and furious, but regular attack, was made on the hustings. The
sheriffs, the candidates (Glynn declares himself as having been the
last to depart), the clerks, and the poll-books, all vanished in a
moment.</p>

<p>“The whole town was presently a scene of blood. It was not
enough to knock down an unhappy man; the blow was followed till
he was utterly disabled. Those who have been exposed to riots declare
they never saw such cruelty. All doors and windows were barricaded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
There was no shelter, nothing was safe; nor can anything equal the
consternation of the frightened people but the abhorrence and
execration with which every tongue repeats the name of Proctor.</p>

<p>“It appears from every account of the above proceedings, that the
people who began the riot there were the friends of the court candidate;
and, in particular, it is affirmed that when the Irish chairmen,
and the professed bruisers at their head, had proceeded so far in their
cruel and villainous intention of murdering and wounding the people,
that the gentlemen upon the hustings began to be in danger of their
lives,&mdash;one gentleman went up to the court candidate, and expostulated
with him on the base conduct of <i>his mob</i>. ‘My mob!’ replied the
courtier. ‘Yes, sir, <i>your mob</i>!’ and the gentleman added, ‘Sir, I
insist upon your speaking to those fellows who are knocking down the
people there.’ But the courtier refused to say anything to appease
their fury; upon which the gentleman who had spoken to him, finding
himself in danger of his life, seized him by the greatcoat, and showed
his star to the armed ruffians, who instantly took off their hats and
huzza’d him; while the ruffians were thus huzzaing, the gentleman
escaped.”</p></blockquote>

<p>When the mob had cleared the hustings, they went into
the town of Brentford, and attacked the Castle Inn, which
was one of the candidate’s houses of entertainment, and
did considerable damage to it. The inhabitants of the
town, observing this mischief, and beginning to fear their
own houses would next be destroyed,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“a general indignation took place: they sallied forth, attacked
the rioters with great spirit, and drove them out of the town; and
some of the voters vented their rage upon one or two of the houses
opened for the other candidate. A number of persons with Proctor’s
cockades in their hats assembled about ‘The Angel Inn’ at Islington
in a riotous manner, armed with bludgeons.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These well-paid hirelings were the worse for their potations,
and, with the ringleader, were taken into custody.</p>

<p>It seems to have been a generally recognized stratagem
imported into election tactics, where, as in war, nothing
was considered “unfair,” to get freeholders locked up on
some fictitious pretence, such as false writs, actions,
summonses, or impounded as witnesses at trials, etc.;
where the principal never appeared, and the hearing never
came on, while the victims “to error” were detained in
durance until after the poll was finished. On the occasion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
under consideration, it appeared that a number of freeholders
were particularly summoned as jurymen, to prevent
their voting for the popular candidate; this manœuvre was
defeated, as concerned the Old Bailey, where the lord
mayor, Turner, behaved in a truly patriotic manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When the jury was called, his Lordship asked them, upon their
honour, if any of them were freeholders of Middlesex; it appeared
that about eighteen of them were so (specially called in order that
their votes might be lost), on which his Lordship immediately dismissed
them, that they might not be hindered from discharging their
duty at Brentford.”</p>

<p>“Richard Dingham maketh oath that ‘the morning after the
meeting of Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, at St. Giles’s, he saw
four link-lighters named Welch, Hinton, Brady, and Quinn, disputing
about some money they had received from Sir William, and they said
that they had signed an agreement to go down, with several others, to
Brentford on the day of Election to head a mob, and to put an end to
the said Election, when they should receive orders, etc.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the interval, and during the progress of the election,
several men were committed to prison, including a chairman
recognized as having acted as a leader, who was
known as the “Infant,” being, in fact, a Hercules over six
feet high; the true facts of the case came out upon examination,
and, before the close of the poll, four affidavits
were published in the papers, the tenour of which went to
prove criminal complicity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Atkinson Bush maketh oath that he was at Brentford on the day
of the election, and seeing a large body of men with labels in their
hats, whereon was written, ‘Proctor and Liberty,’ this deponent
asked them whether they were all voters for Proctor? upon which
they declared they had no votes, but had in their hands what was as
good, and showed him their bludgeons; and being asked who they
supposed would get the election, they replied Proctor, swearing, if
Glynn got the advantage, ‘By G&mdash;&mdash;, we will have his blood!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Broughton, the notorious pugilist, happened to find
congenial occupation, having been selected as a temporary
generalissimo of the forces, with special recruiting powers
as to the enlistment of his desperadoes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“William Wheeler, Joyce, Davis, and other chairmen made oath
that they, with about forty of their order, were engaged by Broughton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
on the promise of a guinea a day each, for the like purpose of putting
an end to the election when the signal should be given, and, according
to the account of the deponents, all the parties mentioned
appeared at Brentford.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the next day (December 14), the poll for the election
of a knight of the shire for the county of Middlesex was
peacefully concluded in the presence of the sheriffs and
the justices of the peace of the county, attended by the
constables to suppress any further demonstrations. At
the close, the numbers stood, for Serjeant Glynn, 1542; Sir
W. B. Proctor, 1278. It was said, “that the number
polled on this occasion exceeded by forty-two the greatest
number ever known to poll at any previous election.”</p>

<p>The contest had been an expensive one; it was declared
that Proctor and his party had been canvassing for six
months; and, as an instance of the cost attending the
election of a knight of the shire, it is set down as worthy
of remark that the ribbons for hats alone, <i>i.e.</i> “favours,”
to distinguish Glynn’s friends, cost four hundred pounds;
the outlay of the Court candidate must have been excessively
heavy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The populace in general, and the people of Brentford in
particular, were very desirous to chair Mr. Serjeant Glynn after the
sheriffs had declared his election; but he very politely entreated them
to decline it, which, after much solicitation, they complied with.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the letter of acknowledgment addressed to his supporters
in the county of Middlesex, the serjeant declares&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As my private advantage and honour were by no means the
motives of your exertions in my behalf, so neither shall they be the
objects of my actions. I consider the choice you have made of me
for your representative as the most authentic declaration of your
abhorrence of those arbitrary and oppressive measures which have
too long disgraced the administration of these kingdoms, and which, if
pursued, cannot fail to destroy our most excellent constitution.</p>

<p>“I hope that your example will lead other counties also to assert
their independence, and that the sacred flame of liberty, which always
ascends, will reach at length the higher orders of this nation, and
warm them likewise to a disdain of offering or accepting the wages of
corruption.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p></blockquote>

<p>John Horne Tooke was only second to the successful
candidate in the eulogiums showered on his name and
conduct at this emergency. A portrait of “the parson of
Brentford” was published, representing him in his clerical
guise, at full length, seated in his study at a table, with
his right arm resting on his “Treatise on Enclosing
Commons, addressed to Sir Jno. Gibbins,” an essay which
brought him an unusually handsome acknowledgment; in
his other hand is a reference to his late correspondence
with the defeated ministerial candidate&mdash;a paper inscribed,
“Mobs made after the Court Fashion, by B. Proctor,
Milliner of Brentford.”</p>

<p>Parson Horne wears a singular wig, with the sides in
what has been described as a “cornuted”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> roll,&mdash;as
peculiar as that affected by his friend Wilkes, to whom he
bears a further resemblance from the obliquity of his eyes,
his right eye having been blind, and fixed in its orbit.</p>

<p>The “Parson of Brentford” appears in the <i>Oxford
Magazine</i>; it is evident that Horne’s parliamentary
aspirations were talked of at this time, for opposite to the
portrait is printed an “Extempore,&mdash;on the report that a
certain Clergyman has a view on a seat in the House of
Commons.”</p>

<p>As in the previous election, there was a charge of
murder, which arose out of the irregularities then committed,
and two Irish chairmen, Balfe and McQuirk,
were tried for the death of Mr. George Clarke, “a young
gentleman of the law, whom curiosity had brought to
Brentford at the late election.” References to this incident
are given in the satirical prints and magazines,
together with the usual report of the trial of the malefactors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
“The Present State of Surgery; or, Modern Practice”
(Dec. 14, 1768), appeared in the <i>Universal Magazine</i>,
vol. v. (April, 1769). This engraving shows Mr. Clarke,
whose skull was fatally injured by a blow from a bludgeon,
placed between two doctors, who are examining his head:
one, a surgeon, is declaring, “If the fever does not kill him,
contusions and fractures are nothing;” the other is of
opinion, “A court plaister will remove the disorder.” One
of a group of surgeons is inquiring of the senior, “Shall
we apply the trepan, sir?” “A Glyster” is proposed as
likely to “evacuate the broken pieces of bone.” The authors
of the mischief, or some of the Irish bludgeon men, are
standing by, and discussing the case: “The doctor says a
broken skull’s nothing if they can but cure the fever.” His
companion replies, “Thank God, we need not fear being
knock’d on the head then!” A bystander is remarking,
“I catch’d a fever from a bludgeon at Brentford myself”&mdash;many
persons besides Clarke having complained of maltreatment
during these riots. “Ay, they were deadly
wise at the Election time,” is the opinion of another. A
spectator ejaculates, “I wish those Irish dogs had kept
the distemper to themselves&mdash;it’s worse than the Itch!”
a double-barrelled allusion to the two trials for wilful
murder which had arisen out of the successive Middlesex
elections&mdash;the Irish chairmen who were the cause of
Clarke’s death, and the Scotch soldiers who killed Allen.
The contusion proved fatal; after languishing a few days
the unfortunate young gentleman succumbed.</p>

<p>The trial of the two chairmen, Balfe and McQuirk,
came on at the Old Bailey, January 14, 1769, and though
the prisoners were provided with an array of learned
counsellors, to the number of five, for their defence, they
were pronounced “guilty,” and sentenced to transportation.
An appeal was made to arrest judgment, but it was overruled,
and the sentences ordered to be executed. Court
influence, in the interval, procured a respite, and the
men ultimately received a royal pardon, signed by Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Rochford, secretary of state, which produced severe
animadversions; see “Junius to the Duke of Grafton,”
and the notes to this letter by John Wade (Edin. 1850). In
the <i>Political Register</i> (IV.) is a copy of the document
setting Balfe and McQuirk free. Meanwhile the College
of Surgeons was consulted, to exonerate the guilty, to the
dissatisfaction of the public.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is said that on a late chirurgical examination, there was the
greatest privacy imaginable supported; not only several young
surgeons (who, being advertised of the meeting, went there for the sake
of instruction) were denied admittance, but there were two sentinels
on the outside of the door to prevent any person from listening.
Strange inquisitorial proceedings!”</p></blockquote>

<p>On Monday, the master, wardens, and examiners of the
Surgeons’ Company, ten in number, of whom five had
appointments under administration, the president being
one, and consequently holding the casting-vote (three of
the committee actually held at that time appointments of
“sergeant-surgeon” to the king, and another was surgeon
to the Dowager Princess of Wales, his mother), met at their
hall in the Old Bailey, in pursuance of a letter from the
Earl of Rochford, one of His Majesty’s principal secretaries
of state, desiring their opinion in relation to a doubt that
had arisen whether the blow which Mr. Clarke received at
the election at Brentford was the cause of his death;
and the above gentlemen, after examining the surgeons,
apothecary, and several others (<i>in camera</i>, as alleged),
returned an answer the same evening to his lordship,
giving it as their unanimous opinion, that the blow was
not the cause of Mr. Clarke’s death. A satirical print, given
in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i> as “A Consultation of Surgeons”
(Feb. 27, 1769), exhibits the supposititious explanation of
the inquiry and verdict. The surgeons are grouped round a
table, on which are pens and ink. The president is pointing
to the decision of the conclave, set down to order for Lord
Rochford&mdash;“It does not appear that he died&mdash;&mdash;” At the
same time a large and well-filled bag of money, held up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
temptingly in the president’s right hand, appears the most
conclusive evidence before the corporation. The chairman
observes, “This [the money] convinces me that Clarke did
not die of the wound he received at Brentford.” A Scotch
surgeon is asserting, “By my Soul, his head was too thick
to be broken, or he would ne’er ha’ gang’d to Brentford.”
The next speaker, regarding the weighty motive in the
president’s charge, avers, “Another such bag would convince
me Clarke never received any blow.” A surgeon,
with his gold-headed cane to his nose, is convinced, “Gold
is good evidence, and carries great weight.” In reference
to the surgeon Foot, who, called in at the time, deposed at the
trial that Clarke died of the blow on head, but was of opinion
that his life might have been saved by judicious treatment,
one of the consulting body, rising from his seat, is
declaring, “Devil burn me, but that same surgeon was
a blockhead; how should a Foot be able to judge of the
Head?” The verdict of the College of Surgeons excited
popular disgust, and various reflections were cast upon
the method by which it was arrived at. The following
appeared in the <i>Public Ledger</i> (April 13, 1769):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is confidently repeated, that while a certain party of gentlemen
were assembled together, in order to consult about vindicating themselves
against Mr. Foot’s appeal, the ghost of Mr. Clarke appeared,
and behaved in a most gross and insulting manner to the whole
committee, which so terrified them all, that they have been very ill
ever since, and it is thought some will not recover.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Considerable interest attaches to the struggle in question,
which made Wilkes a hero for a while. It was a time of
trial as regarded the inviolability of the constitution. The
ministers, safe in their bought majority in the Commons,
ready to vote mechanically, seemed utterly callous as to
the consequences of those infractions they were making
on national liberties, presumably secured on an unassailable
basis. The more impartial-minded of the people began
to dread the attempted revival of despotic and irresponsible
government and of those evils which had been guarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
against by great exertions, firmness, and no slight sacrifices
in the past. The spirit of resistance was abroad, and
ministers for their own purposes disguised by every means
the true condition of affairs from the head of the State.
As the violation of popular liberties recalled the struggles
which marked the later Stuart era, so were the means
taken to resist these encroachments compared to the conduct
of the people and their tribunes under the same trying
circumstances. Petitions and remonstrances began to
make ministers tremble lest the sympathies of the throne
might be turned to their proper channel, the people.</p>

<p>Another election for Middlesex occurred in 1769, <i>vice</i>
Wilkes; the results were that Wilkes was returned at the
head of the poll, while his opponent (with a quarter of his
votes) was declared duly elected. On the subject of Colonel
Luttrell’s admission to the House much was said which
must have been unpalatable to the Court. The <i>Oxford
Magazine</i> printed a list of those members who were so
patriotically inclined as to resist this brazen violation of
the constitution, as “the Minority who voted 1148 in preference
to 296;” while those members who servilely voted
for the right of the ministers to impose a defeated candidate
on the Commons were described as “the Majority who
preferred 296 to 1143.” A list is given of these placemen,
pensioners, and courtiers, with particulars against their
respective names which account for their lack of principle,
all being in receipt of State patronage, or emolument of
one kind or another, sufficient to prove that self-interest
was their guiding principle, and that their consciences
were closed by the greed of preferment. The despotic
action enforced by the administration, in defiance of the
principles of the constitution,&mdash;a common practice in the
reign of George III.,&mdash;provoked a very pertinent disquisition
upon the potentiality of the bulwark of popular rights.
The great Lord Bacon, somewhere talking of the power
of parliaments, says, there is nothing which a parliament
cannot do; and he had reason. A parliament can revive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
or abrogate old laws, and make new ones; settle the
succession to the Crown; impose taxes; establish forms
of religion; naturalize foreigners; dissolve marriages;
legitimate bastards; attaint a man of treason, etc. Lord
Bolingbroke, indeed, is of a different opinion, and affirms
there is something which a parliament cannot do: it cannot
annul the constitution; and that if it should attempt
to annul the constitution, the whole body of the people
would have a right to resist it. It is natural, too, to think
that Lord Bacon limited the power of parliament, great
as he believed it, to those things which do not imply a
physical impossibility. Modern ministers, however, have
shown that a parliament is able, at least in appearance,
to effect even such impossibilities. Sir Robert Walpole
was wont to boast that he had “trained his fellows,” as
he called his venal majority in the House of Commons, “in
such a manner, and brought them to such exact discipline,
that were he to desire them to vote Jesus Christ a Gildon”
(<i>i.e.</i> the head of an infidel sect, Gildon being a deistical
writer in Walpole’s day) “he was sure of their compliance.”
The ministry then in office (the Grafton administration), as
will appear by the list referred to above, had assumed a
power no less arbitrary and equally unreasonable, by
persuading their servile majority to vote in defiance of the
constitution on the question of Colonel Luttrell’s qualifications
to sit in the Commons&mdash;that the 296 suffrages
(recorded for Luttrell) were preferable to the 1143 polled
for Wilkes.</p>

<p>The ministerial conduct on the case of Wilkes and
upon the events arising therefrom, joined with their ill-advised
manœuvres on behalf of their own chosen candidates,
produced a marked effect on the constituencies
elsewhere, and, as Horace Walpole writes to his friend, Sir
H. Mann (March 23, 1769), towns began to break off from
their allegiance to the administration in power, and sent
instructions to their members to oppose the measures of the
Court party. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>“As the session approached, Lord Chatham

engaged with a new warmth in promoting petitions.” In
opposition alike to the “Remonstrances,” and to those
who questioned the policy of turning a deaf ear to the
petitions of the nation&mdash;loyal to the throne, but earnestly
set upon the reform of abuses and the extinction of
“grievances,”&mdash;the ministers encouraged their adherents
to secure addresses approving their acts, and praying the
throne to disregard petitions for rights. The public prints
satirized these servile expressions, manufactured to order,
while the wits and caricaturists mercilessly exposed the
<i>modus operandi</i> of fabricating these illegitimate addresses.
According to Horace Walpole, Calcraft and Sir John
Mawbey “by zeal and activity obtained a petition from the
county of Essex, though neither the High Sheriff, the
members, nor any one gentleman of the county would
attend the meeting.” It was the old story of the Essex
petitions over again, as already set down in the group
of “Election Ballads” under Charles II., when the same
county made itself conspicuous in a similar fashion: “It
was thought wise,” wrote Walpole, “to procure loyal
addresses, and one was obtained from Essex, which being
the great county for calves, obtained nothing but ridicule.”
A pictorial version sets forth the situation (March 6, 1769)
as “The Essex Procession from Chelmsford to St. James’s
Market, for the good of the Common-Veal.” The engraving
represents a street ending in the archway of St. James’s,
towards which are progressing two carts, drawn by donkeys
tandem-wise, and filled with bleating calves. The cart is
driven by Rigby, the Duke of Bedford’s factotum, a supporter
of the Court, much interested in the petitions presented
to the king at this period: this political agent is
travestied as an ass; he is crying, “Calves’ Heads &agrave; la
daube! Who’ll buy my veal?” One of the victimized
calves in the cart is bleating, “This is a Rig-by-Jove;”
another exclaims, “How we expose ourselves!” The other
charioteer is intended for C. Dingley, author of the “Saw-mill”
experiment at Limehouse, and who was an influential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
projector of the new “City-road;” he was a creature of
the Duke of Grafton, a prominent ally of the Court faction
against Wilkes and the patriots, and was generally
obnoxious to the more constitutionally minded of the
citizens. Dingley is transformed into an ox, and he is made
to declare to his special consignment of calves, “Friends
and Countrymen, you shall not be misrepresented.” One
of the calf contingent, mindful of slaughter, is bleating, “I
hope they won’t drive us to St. George’s Fields,” the place
of slaughter&mdash;otherwise, the scene of the recent wanton
attacks of the Scottish soldiery on the people; while
another of Dingley’s followers is expressing a wish that
the famous saw-mills, which were the cause of a riot in
which they were demolished, might prove the destruction
of the speculator himself. In opposition to the “foolish
Essex address,” it was, as described in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>, “resolved at a meeting of gentlemen held at
Chelmsford, December 15, 1769, to support the right of
election to Parliament, and to petition the king for a dissolution
of Parliament.”</p>

<p>The Essex address was followed up, on the part of
what were entitled London merchants, by a similar production,
which was chiefly promoted by Charles Dingley;
a version of this transaction is entitled “The Addressers.”
It appears that “officious tools,” and interested, if not
bribed, citizens, designated as “the Merchants of London,”
attended, March 8, 1769, at the King’s Arms Tavern,
Cornhill, at the invitation of Dingley and his followers.
One shilling was charged at the door to keep away the
crowd, ostensibly to defray the expense of the room; and
one Lovell, having complied with this, found Dingley with
a few others assembled. Mr. Muilmann, a German or
Dutch stockbroker, professionally nicknamed “Van Scrip,”
gave Lovell a copy of the address to read, and told him he
could sign the original then on the table; but on Lovell’s
expressing that “he did not approve of the address,”
Dingley ordered him out; but, having paid his shilling, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
stood on his right to remain. Then followed Reynolds
(who was Wilkes’s attorney), and having paid his shilling,
and refusing to sign the address, was also asked to leave,
but elected to enjoy the privilege of remaining. Vaughan
and others did the same. The room being then filled,
when Mr. Charles Pole was invited to take the chair at
the suggestion of the anti-addressers, their opponents
“opposed all order,” repeating the cry of “No chair!”
with the utmost fury, and threatening to “turn down
stairs all who called for any chairman.” The chair itself
became an object of contention between the hostile
parties; one secured the seat, another the frame, and the
“abhorrers of disorder” triumphed until another chair
was obtained. The ticklish office of president was at last
accepted by Mr. Vaughan. Attorney Reynolds was standing
near the chairman, when Dingley, enraged at the
success of this counter-demonstration, addressing him as a
“d&mdash;&mdash;d scoundrel,” struck him a violent blow in the face;
on which provocation, Reynolds, being of commanding size,
knocked Dingley down. “Many were the efforts made to
dispossess Mr. Vaughan of the chair, strokes were aimed
at him with canes and sticks, but the blows were warded
off by his friends.”</p>

<p>Such is the disturbance set forth in the satirical
engraving of “The Addressers” (March 8, 1769), in which
is represented the <i>fracas</i> at the King’s Arms Tavern
consequent on this insidious attempt to manufacture a
bogus address. Attorney Reynolds’s wig is awry, from the
blow inflicted by Dingley; he is knocking the latter out
of the chair, and exclaiming, “I’ll make you pay for this.”
Dingley is saying, “For this &pound;2000 more;” while, in falling,
from his pocket drops a paper, “Saw-mill, &pound;2000.”
“Van Scrip,” Muilmann, alluding to the cash considerations
held out by the ministers to their allies, is extending his
hand, and crying in dismay, “We shall lose this scrip!”
A spectator, armed with a riding-whip, is asserting, “You’ll
be Jockey’d, Mynheer.” The persons in the crowd are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
demanding, “A chair! a chair!” while others shout to the
contrary; the chair itself is mounted on a table placed in
the middle of the room. Mr. Apvan (Vaughan) is occupying
this perilous distinction. “Why <i>address</i>, Gentlemen?” is
his question to the meeting. A slight fencing-match is
going on; the chairman holding his own, while those who
attack him cry “Order.” A clergyman&mdash;no other than the
“Brentford Parson” in person&mdash;is suggesting the propriety
of “an Address to keep the streets clean,” the condition
of the thoroughfares in London being the subject of
complaint at this time. From the report of these proceedings
published in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, it appears that
a speaker asserted that the “proper functions of such an
assembly were to order the scavengers to clean the
streets, and beadles to remove vagrants from them.” The
fragments of the chair first dismantled, as described, are
in the hands of some of the company by the door. A man
has gone down in his exertions “to stand up for the
Address.” The incendiary document in question is carried
off by one Mr. Phelim O’Error, who is declaring, “I’ll take
it to the Merchant Seamen’s Office,” to which it was
removed on the next stage of its career.</p>

<p>Another version of these proceedings appeared, March 8,
1769, as “The Battle of Cornhill;” an engraving given in
the <i>Town and Country Magazine</i>, with a short parody in
the style of a drama on the subject, as detailed in the
foregoing “Addressers.” The counter-assault upon Dingley
is similarly illustrated. Reynolds, the Attorney Freeman
of the drama, is depicted as a tall, burly man. Dingley is
made to cry, “Murder, murder. Oh, the rascal. I’ll
have him imprisoned seven years for this illegal attack.
He has done me twelve hundred, if not two thousand
pounds damage.” Van Scrip is much alarmed: “Heaven!
what will become of me! I shall lose all my interest in
the Treasury, if we fail in carrying it. I shan’t have a
single government contract, not so much as a thousand
pounds scrip.” An anecdote is related in the <i>London</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
<i>Museum</i> (ii. 1770, p. 32) concerning the use of lottery
tickets as bribes by the Government, where Bradshaw,
secretary to the Treasury, stigmatized by “Junius” as
“the cream-coloured parasite,” is alleged to have “met
the member for Buckinghamshire (Lowndes), and offered
two hundred lottery tickets at ten pounds each, which were
accepted.” Scrip and lottery tickets were freely employed
for political bribery at this period, as Walpole mentions
in his “Memoirs of the Reign of King George the Third,”
and Sir H. N. Wraxall describes in his “Historical Memoirs.”</p>

<p>“The Inchanted Castle; or, King’s Arms in an Uproar”
(March 8, 1769) is a further pictorial version of the same
occurrence, with little variation as to the persons or
incidents represented, but containing a reference, like the
last, to the “London Tavern,” the recognized head-quarters
and meeting-place for the Society of Supporters of the
Bill of Rights, and consequently opposed to sycophantic
admiration of ministerial illegalities. Beneath the print
in question is a copy of verses, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I sing the bloody fight and dire alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt London Tavern and King’s Arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planning Addresses Dingley’s party sate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meditating on their Country’s fate.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Horace Walpole thus describes the transactions represented
in the foregoing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The merchants of London, to the number of six or eight hundred,
amongst whom were Dutch, Jews, and any officious tools that they could
assemble, having signed one of those servile panegyrics [addresses], set
out in a long procession of coaches, to carry it to St. James’s.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>modus operandi</i> by which the address was promoted
is fancifully summed up in the plate of the <i>Oxford
Magazine</i>, vol. ii., p. 134, “The Principal Merchants and
Traders assembled at the Merchant Seamen’s Office, to
sign ye Address.” This print represents a further stage in
the progress of the transaction. The <i>Public Advertiser</i>,
March 11, 1769, announces, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>“For these two Days past,

numbers of the Merchants and principal Traders of
London have attended at the Merchant Seamen’s Office,
over the Royal Exchange, in order to sign an Address to
his Majesty, etc.”</p>

<p>It is stated in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>, “So eager were the
ministers to procure a long list of subscribers that, it is
credibly reported, some of the addresses of the then ‘City
Merchants,’ were signed by cobblers, porters, chairmen,
livery-servants, and the very meanest of the rabble; for as
the number of hands was the chief point of view, they
cared but little of what rank or condition they were.”
The caricaturist has carried out this view of the signatories.
The chairman or president is a butcher, whose tray, containing
a shoulder of mutton, is laid down at his feet; he
is filled with loyal frenzy, and, with his butcher’s knife
grasped ready for action, is exclaiming, “I shall stick my
knife in <i>Magna Charta</i>, and cut up the carcase of the Bill
of Rights.” A porter, with his knot, is anathematizing
Wilkes’s “swivel eyes,” and wishing he “may sink under
his load.” The petition is being signed by a barber, with
his bowl under his arm, together with an aldermanic wig
just ordered: “Ah, I’ve got an order for a new wig, only for
signing my name.” A Scotch pedlar, with pack and staff,
one of Lord Bute’s followers, declares, “Sawney mun sign
too, gin it be to the De’il, for my guid laird’s sake.” A
journeyman baker, with a basketful of loaves on his back,
is coming in succession, well paid for his assistance:
“Brother Merchants, follow my example, and you’ll never
want bread;” and even a sooty chimney-sweep has expectations
of ministerial patronage, “Who knows but I may
be appointed to a Chimney at Court?” Prominent among
those at the table whereon is the much-denounced
“Address,” is a Jew money-jobber, who is elated at his
prospects of a Treasury “job,” “Oh! for a large portion of
scrip!” and the Dutch stockbroker, Van Scrip, is exclaiming,
“Ah! de gross Scrip for Mynheer too,”&mdash;the subscription
scrip to government loans, profitable to those who secured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
preference allotments, and, as described, alleged to be
manipulated by the ministry in the nature of bribery.</p>

<p>The strictures provoked upon the underhand methods
by which these addresses were forced upon the public are
exemplified in an “Epistle to the <i>North Briton</i>,” which
appeared in the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>, to accompany the
engraving of the “Addressing Merchants.” The epistle is
lengthy, and we have only room for the opening passages.
It is possibly written by the “Brentford Parson;” indeed,
the manner as well as matter indicates the authorship
suggested. The motto is given, “There is nothing new
under the sun” (<i>Eccles.</i> i. 9)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“And so, sir, what you have often foretold is at last come to pass.
We are fairly fallen back into the very dregs of the Stuart reigns.
The party of <i>Abhorrers</i> is once more revived; of those <i>Abhorrers</i>, who,
in the reign of King Charles the Second, expressed their detestation
of all the patriotic and public spirited, as I would say&mdash;but, as they
were pleased to call them, the factious and insolent petitions that
were presented to the king for assembling a parliament, and for
securing the other rights and liberties of the People.</p>

<p>“That such wretches should have existed at a time when the
Sovereign claimed, and many of his subjects were willing to allow him,
a divine, indefeasible, hereditary right to play the tyrant, and to
destroy the constitution is nothing strange; but that any such should
be found in the reign of a prince, whose family was advanced to the
throne in direct contradiction to this absurd principle, would be really
surprising, did we not know that human nature is always the same, and
that though the seeds of slavery may be smothered for a time, yet
whenever they meet with the vivifying influence of court sunshine,
they immediately begin to quicken, and to spring up with vigour.
And never, sure, did these seeds meet with a more fertile soil, or a
more benign sky, than under the present arbitrary and despotic
administration, when every man is sure to be rewarded in exact
proportion to the servility of his character.</p>

<p>“In this respect, indeed, the present ministers have greatly the
advantage of all that have gone before them; for I do not remember
a single compliment paid to the <i>Abhorrers</i>, in the reign of King Charles
the Second, except the honour of knighthood conferred upon Francis
Withers, Esq., who procured and presented the Address from the City
of Westminster. But how much more grateful and generous have
been our present ministers! They have made the late chief City
Magistrate a Privy Councillor, and have given him a contract with
government for clothing soldiers, worth &pound;1000 per annum. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
have pardoned the murderers MacLaughlin, Balfe, and McQuirk, and
have even granted them pensions. This, say the ministry, is only
supporting their friends; but, if murderers be their friends, I believe
few people will envy them the credit of such a connection.</p>

<p>“Some of the addresses in the reign of the Stuarts breathed a very
free and independent spirit. That of the Quakers, upon the accession
of King James the Second, may serve as an instance. It was conceived
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘We come,’ said they, ‘to testify our sorrow for the death of our
good friend Charles, and our joy for thy being made our governor.
We are told thou art not of the persuasion of the Church of England,
no more than we; wherefore we hope thou wilt grant us the same
liberty which thou allowest thyself. Which doing, we wish thee all
manner of happiness.’</p>

<p>“There we see the Quakers, with their usual plainness and simplicity,
very roundly tell his majesty, that he was not a member of the church
of England; a circumstance, which was then thought by many, and
hath since been declared by law, to be sufficient to disqualify him for
wearing the crown of these Kingdoms.</p>

<p>“But how much more courtly and polite is the language of our
present Addressers. They not only pay the highest compliments to the
King, which he certainly deserves, they even offer the most nauseous
and fulsome flattery to his ministers and servants, and express their
entire approbation of every part of their conduct. They must therefore
approve of the robbery committed upon the Duke of Portland, of
the massacre in St. George’s Fields, of the riot and murders at
Brentford, of withdrawing MacLaughlin from the cognizance of the
laws, and of pardoning Balfe and McQuirk after they had been fairly
tried and condemned by their country.</p>

<p>“But, not satisfied with declaring their approbation of the conduct
of the ministry, they express their utter abhorrence and detestation of
the conduct of those who have had the presumption to oppose them.
They must, therefore, <i>abhor</i> the conduct of the Freeholders of Middlesex,
who chose Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Serjeant Glynn, their representatives
in parliament, in spite of all the violent, outrageous, and illegal
attempts which the ministry made to prevent them. They must <i>abhor</i>
the conduct of the 139 independent members who voted against the
expulsion of Mr. Wilkes from an august assembly, of which they form
the respectable, and perhaps even the most wealthy, tho’ not the most
numerous part. They must <i>abhor</i> the conduct of the Citizens of
London, of the Citizens of Westminster, of the Freeholders of Middlesex,
and of all the other counties and corporations, who, in their
instructions to their representatives, have disapproved of those very
measures which the Addressers approve. In a word, they must abhor
the conduct, at least the sentiments, of ninety-nine parts in a hundred
of the people of England, who, if taken separately, and fairly interrogated,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
would be found to entertain opinions very different from those
of the Addressers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The “Battle of Cornhill,” otherwise the fight for the
signatures to the servile loyal address as already described,
was followed by another stage in the contest, an
attempt to carry the address in state through the city,
the procession being stopped by a conflict in Fleet Street,
of which turbulent episode a caricature appeared, March
22, 1769, under the title of the “Battle of Temple Bar.”
The engraving offers a vista of Fleet Street; the Devil
Tavern, the arched entrance to the Temple, and Nando’s
Coffee-house are shown to the right; the gates of the bar
are closed, and around is a scene of confused conflict. The
decapitated heads of Fletcher and Townley, stuck on poles
over Temple Bar, are represented in conversation. The
Jacobites executed for their share in the Scottish raid
of 1745 are inquiring whether the Addressers are not
“friends to the cause which we all love so dear,” and
which had planted their heads on the bar over twenty years
before. A carriage, drawn by two horses, is the centre
of the struggle; the coachman is observing “They all
seem in a fair way;” the rabble are pelting the vehicle,
from which the person charged with the care of the loyal
address is making his escape. Another member of the
party bound for St. James’s is seeking shelter from the
shower of missiles at the entrance to Nando’s. Other
coaches have been subjected to similar indignities; the
servants are declaring, “Our masters are finely bedaubed!”
The city marshal and his charger are under fire from the
mob; grasping his baton and holding his hat to protect
his face, the marshal declares, “I find I must go to y<sup>e</sup>
Devil!” The Devil, perched on the sign of the famous
tavern christened after his name, is crying, with a Scotch
twang, “in compliment to my Lord Bute,” “Fly to me, my
Bairns!” This plate is given in the <i>London Magazine</i>,
with an account of the pelting and flight of those who were
engaged in carrying the address to the king.</p>

<p>The concluding stage in the progress of the address
and the cavalcade of carriages which attended it, was
marked by the appearance of the satirical engraving
entitled the “Sequel to the Battle of Temple Bar,” 1769,
of which a reduced fac-simile is given. The spot represented
is the front of St. James’s Palace, facing St. James’s
Street. The remnants of the procession of merchants
charged with the address in support of the ministry in
power are escaping down Pall Mall, the carriages, with
broken windows, being followed by galling volleys of stones
and dirt on the part of the mob, while a hearse exhibiting
inflammatory placards is accorded an enthusiastic reception.
The spectators gathered at the St. James’s Coffee House
and around the palace are encouraging the hostile demonstration;
the courtiers are surveying the tumult from the
gateway and windows of St. James’s Palace. A person
mounted on the tower, and assumed to be intended for
Lord Bute, is pointing to the weathercock, exclaiming,
“High north wind,” <i>i.e.</i> a Scotch wind. The Guards are
making attacks upon individuals; a gentleman is being
surrounded; the violence of the soldiers is watched by a
clergyman, evidently intended for Parson Horne, whose
eye was upon those who infringed the rights of the subjects
or unlawfully maltreated any of the people. A burlesque
funeral procession diversified the proceedings, headed by
a mounted mute, wearing a crape weeper, with mourning
staff, the hearse drawn by two wretched screws, one black
and one white; the coachman is equally odd&mdash;the person
who drove was declared to have been a frolicsome lordling,
it is said young Earl Mountmorres. The body of this
vehicle displays a flaring placard&mdash;the presentment of
an Irish chairman striking with a bludgeon a person who
is knocked down and defenceless; this moving picture,
inscribed “Brentford,” represents the fate of Mr. Clarke,
whose fractured skull, caused by the brutal attack of
Proctor’s hired ruffians, ended in his death. Similar
placards, “St. George’s Fields” and “Scot Victory,” are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
posted on the hearse to remind the ministers that the odium
of the massacre of the people at St. George’s Fields, and
the deliberate assassination of William Allen (May 10,
1768), by a grenadier of the Scottish Regiment, were not
forgotten; a coloured picture of this episode was displayed
on the other side of the hearse. A diversion is attempted
at the entrance to the palace gates, where the figure of a
short nobleman is distinguishable by the star on his coat;
he is using his broken official staff like a sword. This
personage, who actually seized one of the rioters, and who
is intended for Earl Talbot, lord steward of the household,
is bareheaded, his wig having been displaced in the scuffle
with the people, and, finally, a knock on the head cooled his
courage; the Guards are coming to his support. Further
details of the ending of this vexed question of the address are
given in the political intelligence of the time. From all
accounts, Mr. Boehm, in whose charge was the fateful roll,
was too occupied in securing his own safety to trouble about
the fate of the address. It appears that the scattered
procession went on to St. James’s without the presenter of
the document which had entailed so many embarrassments.
According to the <i>Political Register</i>, a messenger was
despatched back to the coffee-house for the address; where
“Mr. Boehm, having missed it, remained in great suspense.”
After many inquiries and great alarm, the roll was
found under the seat of the coach, where, by a miracle, it
had escaped the search of the mob; the address was
immediately forwarded to St. James’s, where it was expectantly
awaited.</p>

<p>The history of this incident is taken up by the <i>Political
Register</i> for 1769:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The merchants and traders who retired with the address mentioned
in the account of the proceedings at the ‘King’s Arms,’ having
by means of repeated advertisements and private letters obtained a
considerable number of persons to sign the said address at the
Merchant Seamen’s Office over the Royal Exchange; ... Wednesday, the
22nd March, at two in the afternoon, being appointed, on that day at
noon, a great number of the merchants, etc., of this city, set out from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the Royal Exchange in their carriages, in order to present an address
to His Majesty, attended by the City Marshal and constables; before
they got to Cheapside, the mob showed them many marks of their
resentment, by hissing, groaning, throwing dirt, etc., but when they
arrived at Fleet Street, the multitude grew quite outrageous, broke
the windows of the coaches, threw stones and glass bottles, and dispatched
a party to shut up the gates at Temple Bar, on which the
cavalcade was obliged to stop. Mr. Cook, the City Marshal, going to
open the gates with his attendants, was very severely treated; his
clothes were torn off his back and his head cut in two places. The
populace then attacked the gentlemen in their carriages; Mr. Boehm
(who carried the roll) and several of his friends being covered with
dirt, were obliged to take refuge in Nando’s Coffee-house. Some of
the coaches then drove up Chancery Lane, Fetter Lane, and Shoe
Lane; but the greater part of the gentlemen, finding it impossible to
proceed, returned home. The Addressers, however, did at length
reach St. James’s, but the mob threw dirt at the gentlemen as they got
out of their carriages at St. James’s Gate.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The few that reached the palace were so covered with dirt
as to be unpresentable, and those of the courtiers who
came within reach of the mob were also bespattered. The
document which was the main cause of this disturbance
was within an ace of never reaching its destination.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When Mr. Boehm was obliged to get out of his coach at Nando’s
Coffee-house to avoid the mob, in his hurry he left the address under
the cushion on one of the seats, and immediately ordered the coachman
to go home; some of the mob opened the coach door, and began
to search for the address, but the coachman declaring ‘it was sent
before’ (though he knew not where it was), they were the less diligent
in their search, and missed laying hold of it, by not feeling six inches
farther on the seat.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the road thither, by the Strand, the additions already
mentioned were made to the cavalcade, to the consternation
of those who formed part of it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When some of the coaches got to Exeter Exchange, a hearse came
out of Exeter Street, and preceded them, drawn by a black and white
horse, the driver of which had on a rough coat, resembling a skin, with
a large cap, one side black, the other white, whose whole figure was
very grotesque. On one side of the hearse was painted on canvas a
representation of the rioters killing Mr. Clarke at the Brentford
election; and on the other side was a representation of the soldiers
firing on young Allen in the cow-house.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Town and Country Magazine</i> (1769) divulges that
the driver of the decorated hearse was “a man of fortune;”
moreover, another account avers&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have always understood that the late Lord Mountmorres, then
a very young man, was the person, who on that occasion, personated
the executioner [of Charles I. ?], holding an axe in his hands, and his
face covered with crape.” (See Wraxall’s “Historical Memoirs;” also
the “Letters of the First Earl of Malmesbury,” etc.)</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The hearse attended the cavalcade, making a short stop
at Carlton House, where the Princess of Wales lived, also
at the residence of the “Cumberland Butcher,” and at
Lord Weymouth’s, in Pall Mall (as the author of the
St. George’s Fields massacre); thence the hearse, with
its “humiliating insignia, was driven into the court-yard
of St. James’s, followed by the mob, after which it went
off to Albemarle Street.” A copy of the address is given
in the <i>Political Register</i> (iv. 1769).</p>

<p>The address and its supporters were in a sad plight
when the levee-room was reached, after the foregoing
vicissitudes. The Duke of Chandos wrote Mr. Grenville&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Out of one hundred and thirty merchants who went up with the
address, only twelve could get to the King, and they were covered in
dirt, as indeed was almost the whole Court.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The riotous crowd continued to create a disturbance at
the palace gates, “accompanied with threats of a most
dangerous kind” (as declared in the royal proclamation);
while the Earl of Malmesbury wrote, “Many of the mob
cried, ‘Wilkes and no King,’ which is shocking to think of.”
At last, the proclamation against tumultuous assemblies
was read, and&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“Several persons taken into custody by the soldiers; and two
were taken by Lord Talbot, who was the only minister who had
sufficient resolution to come down among the mob; his lordship had
secured another, who was rescued, and his lordship received a violent
blow on the head, by being thrown against a coach, and then thought
it prudent to take shelter among the soldiers.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">A grand council at St. James’s was held on the afternoon
of these events, and in the evening a <i>Gazette Extraordinary</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
was published, with a proclamation by the king&mdash;who had
in person witnessed the disturbances attending the sham
address,&mdash;“for suppressing riots,” etc., beginning&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Whereas it has been represented to us that divers dissolute and
disorderly persons have most riotously and unlawfully assembled
themselves together, to the disturbance of the public peace, and have,
in a most daring and audacious manner, assaulted several merchants
and others, coming to our palace at St. James’s, and have committed
many acts of violence and outrage before the gates of our palace,” etc.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The proclamation further charges the lord mayor, and
justices of the peace for the cities of London and Westminster,
borough of Southwark, and counties of Middlesex
and Surrey, to prevent and suppress all riots, tumults, and
unlawful assemblies, etc.</p>

<p>Another engraving on the same topic&mdash;as described by
Mr. Edward Hawkins, from whose collection, bequeathed
to the British Museum, many of these early illustrations
are selected&mdash;was entitled:&mdash;</p>

<h3>“THE GOTHAM ADDRESSERS; OR, A PEEP AT
THE HEARSE.”</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sing the Addressers who lately set out<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The procession and hearse (the driver is exclaiming
“Wilkes and Liberty”) are again shown at St. James’s
Palace. The chief promoter, Charles Dingley, is made the
principal butt of this satire, and, as the address began with
him, it is appropriately so terminated. The hearse with
the placards is succeeded by a coach bearing on the roof
a windmill, an allusion to Dingley’s too famous saw-mills
at Limehouse, which were dismantled by the sawyers out
of work and other rioters. The coachman of this equipage
is endeavouring to pacify the mob: “Wilkes and Liberty,
Gentlemen; I had no hand in the d&mdash;&mdash;d Address.” The
chief offender, seen inside the coach, is also appealing to
the incensed crowd: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>“For God’s sake, Gentlemen, spare
me; I wish the Address had been in Hell before I meddled

with it.” His bemired footman is declaring, “My livery’s
like my master, d&mdash;&mdash;d Dirty.” The next coach has on it
a zany with cap and bells, seated “on the Massacre of
Aboyna;” this figure of folly is exclaiming, “I give Mr.
Dingle the lead;” the rider, one of the loan-contractors and
bidders for ministerial favour, cries, “Ayez piti&eacute; de moi!”
“Dingle’s Downfall, a new Song,” is chanted by a female
ballad-singer. Dead cats and mud are thrown at the
procession, which is followed by the groans and hisses of
the spectators.</p>

<p>The foregoing events are further elucidated in “A
Dialogue between the Two Heads on Temple Bar.” The
narrator professes to have overheard the following conversation
upon politics between the decapitated heads of the
1745 rebels stuck over Temple Bar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Petitions and remonstrances began to make ministers
tremble lest finally the sympathies of the throne might be
turned into the proper channel, and the king be led to
espouse the cause of the people, who, to do them justice,

described as occurring under Charles II. and George III.,
and which had more than a casual resemblance.</p>

<p>The remonstrances of the citizens were persistently laid

</div></div>
</div>

<p>On July 5, 1769, the Livery of London presented a
petition to the king; the lord mayor, Samuel Turner, Sir
Robert Ladbrooke,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Alderman Beckford, and other friends
of popular liberty being charged with this statement of
grievances, of which the following extracts must suffice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We should be wanting in our duty to your Majesty, as well as to
ourselves and our posterity, should we forbear to represent to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
throne the desperate attempts that have been, and are too successfully,
made to destroy that constitution to the spirit of which we owe the
relation which subsists between your Majesty and the subjects of these
realms, and to subvert those sacred laws which our ancestors have
sealed with their blood.</p>

<p>“Your ministers, from corrupt principles and in violation of every
duty, have, by various enumerated means, invaded our invaluable
and inalienable right of trial by jury.</p>

<p>“They have, with impunity, issued general warrants, and violently
seized persons and private papers.</p>

<p>“They have rendered the laws non-effective to our security, by
invading the Habeas Corpus.</p>

<p>“They have caused punishments and even perpetual imprisonment
to be inflicted, without trial, conviction, or sentence.</p>

<p>“They have brought into disrepute the civil magistracy, by the
appointment of persons who are, in many respects, unqualified for
that important trust, and have thereby purposely furnished a pretence
for calling in the aid of the military power.</p>

<p>“They avow, and endeavour to establish, a maxim absolutely
inconsistent with our constitution, that ‘an occasion for effectually
employing a military force always presents itself, when the civil power
is trifled with or insulted;’ and by a fatal and false application of
this maxim, they have wantonly and wickedly sacrificed the lives of
many of your Majesty’s innocent subjects, and have prostituted your
Majesty’s sacred name and authority, to justify, applaud, and recommend
their own illegal and bloody actions.</p>

<p>“They have screened more than one murderer from punishment,
and in its place have unnaturally substituted reward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And after having insulted and defeated the law on different
occasions, and by different contrivances, both at home and abroad,
they have at length completed their design, by violently wresting
from the people the <i>last sacred right we had left</i>, the right of election,
by the unprecedented seating of a candidate notoriously set up and
chosen only by themselves. They have thereby taken from your
subjects all hopes of parliamentary redress, and have left us no
resource, under God, but in your Majesty.</p>

<p>“All this they have been able to effect by corruption; by a
scandalous misapplication and embezzlement of the public treasure,
and a shameful prostitution of public honours and employments;
procuring deficiencies of the civil lists to be made good without
examinations; and, instead of punishing, conferring honours on a
paymaster, the public defaulter of unaccounted millions.</p>

<p>“From an unfeigned sense of the duty we owe to your Majesty,
and to our country, we have ventured thus humbly to lay before the
throne these great and important truths, which it has been the business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
of your Ministers to conceal. We most earnestly beseech your Majesty
to grant us redress. It is for the purpose of redress alone, and for
such occasions as the present, that those great and extensive powers
are entrusted to the Crown by the wisdom of that Constitution which
your Majesty’s illustrious family was chosen to defend, and which we
trust in God it will for ever continue to support.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Of each paragraph given in the foregoing the meaning
was conclusive, the instance known to all. There is in
this petition no statement exaggerated, no sentiment overcoloured,
considering that one paragraph alone describes
no less than the suicidal measures which dismembered the
empire, and cost the mother country the allegiance of
“the colonies,” <i>i.e.</i> the continent of America, in these plain
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“They [the Grafton administration] have established numberless
unconstitutional regulations and taxations in our colonies. They
have caused a revenue to be raised in some of them by prerogative.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However meritorious the cause, it was an offence to a
king whose mind, never remarkable for lucidity, was then
under “the influence of the worst of counsellors,” as stated
in the first prayer of the petition. The document&mdash;when
the petitioners were, after much discouragement, delay,
and many subterfuges, and, “although no time could be
fixed for its acceptance,” permitted to approach the
presence at a levee&mdash;was at last presented; but the king
made no reply, but, handing the petition to the lord-in-waiting,
turned his back on the presenters, who represented
the integrity and commercial greatness of the city of
London and were its elected guardians, and addressed
Baron Dieden, the Danish ambassador, who was standing
in his vicinity, on an indifferent topic.</p>

<p>After the late fulsome reception of “bogus addressers”
nothing could be more contemptible than the studied
impertinence with which the Corporation of London was
treated, and the affront of leaving the civil magistrate to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“skulk about the passages of the Court that he may have a glimpse of
His Majesty as he passes along in state, in order to deliver into his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
hands a remonstrance affecting the most essential interests of above
twelve millions of people, who by the sweat of their brow support the
pomp and parade of royalty and swell the fastidious pride and
coxcombical vanity of empty courtiers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was boldly hazarded at this emergency, from the
premeditated affront to the representatives alike of the
city and the people, that the rulers, blinded to their own
destruction, then concluded&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“themselves sufficiently prepared for the final extirpation of liberty
in this island, and that by deliberate insults they were urging the
people to commit some outrage, which might give them a pretence
for putting their scheme of tyranny into immediate execution.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If the city, by its dignified and law-abiding demeanour,
disappointed these expectations, it was argued that the
Court party would not wait for an excuse to wreak their
vengeance under some thin disguise of retributive justice,
but would proceed to order out the “Scotch Regiment, as
in the affair of St. George’s Fields, without waiting for the
least appearance of necessity.”</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>, writing under
the signature “Philopolis,” referring to the threatened
massacres in St. George’s Fields, and, on the grounds that
the late firing did comparatively little damage to the rioters
concerned, declared:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have heard it indeed alleged by courtiers in excuse, that all
the military execution of that day was solely aimed at Mr. Wilkes,
who they hoped would be despatched by some lucky shot, as Herod
expected our Saviour would be murdered among the innocents he
murdered at Bethlehem. As a proof of this extenuation of the crime,
they show flatted balls, which were discharged by heroes planted in
proper places for the purpose, and which have left marks in the walls
about the windows of Mr. Wilkes’s apartments in the King’s Bench.”
“If this has any foundation in truth,” writes “Philopolis,” “I would
advise the city to be cautious, and never allow above a dozen of its
inhabitants to be seen together at one time, for fear the Riot Act
should arrive unexpectedly, with two or three brigades of musqueteers,
headed by a trading justice, who may think nothing of the citizens’
lives, provided he has any hopes of murdering Beckford and the two
sheriffs through their sides.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The petition presented by the lord mayor with such
difficulty, and after many insolent subterfuges and repulses,
failed to bring the king to a reasonable sense of his
situation or of the dangers to which the throne was
exposed by the reckless and unconstitutional conduct of
the administration. Subsequently, on the presentation
of a “remonstrance,” the king returned a written reply
to the original petition, visiting with severe censure the
persevering claim of invaded birthrights, urged by “the
afflicted citizens,” and treating their just grievances with
reprimand instead of redress; the pleas set forth in the
petitions being considered by His Majesty “as disrespectful
to himself, injurious to his parliament, and irreconcileable
to the principles of the constitution”&mdash;a piece of bold
duplicity more worthy of the Stuart dynasty.</p>

<p>The vexed question of Middlesex election, the imprisonment
of Wilkes, the unconstitutional admission of Luttrell
into the House, and particularly the supineness of the
King to the petitions and just remonstrances of his people,
are embodied in a metrical form, as&mdash;</p>

<p>In the March of the year following, after awaiting a
response for nearly twelve months, the Livery of the city
resolved to draw up a further and more stringent
remonstrance; and a meeting was held under the Right
Hon. William Beckford, elected lord mayor for the second
time, in the interval. In his address “to the Supreme
Court of the whole City,” the real dangers which menaced
the State were by Beckford traced to their true source,
“the comprehensive violation of the <i>right of election</i>”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“to preserve which right, the Crown had been justly taken from
James the Second, and been placed by the people of England on the
head of William the Third, and conferred on His Majesty’s family.
That the corruption of the people’s representatives was the cause and
foundation of all our grievances. That we have now only the name of
a parliament, without the substance.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">He observed how improper it was for <i>placemen</i> and
<i>pensioners</i> to sit in the House of Commons; “for if a
man was not fit to be a Juryman, or a Judge in a cause
where he was interested, how much less to be a Senator
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
and justify his peculation.” “<i>He complained of the unequal
and inadequate representation of the people, by means of the
little, rotten, paltry boroughs.</i>” In the remonstrance drawn
up on this occasion, the wrongs of the people were again
eloquently urged, and it was especially pointed out that
the House of Commons, by the venal majority&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“had deprived the people of their dearest rights. They have done
a deed more ruinous in its consequence than the levying of ship-money
by Charles the First, or the dispensing power assumed by James the
Second. A deed which must vitiate all the future proceedings of this
parliament; for the acts of the legislature itself can no more be valid
without a legal House of Commons than without a legal prince upon
the throne.</p>

<p>“Representatives of the people are essential to the making of laws,
and there is a time when it is morally demonstrable that men cease
to be representatives. That time is now arrived. The present House
of Commons do not represent the people. We owe to your Majesty
an obedience under the restriction of the laws, for the calling and
duration of Parliaments; and your Majesty owes to us, that our
representation, free from the force of arms or corruption, should be
preserved to us in them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The forms of the Constitution, like those of Religion, were not
established for form’s sake, but for the substance. And we call God
and man to witness that we do not owe our Liberty to those nice and
subtle distinctions, which <i>places</i>, and <i>pensions</i>, and <i>lucrative employments</i>
have invented; so neither will we be cheated of it by them, but as it
was gained by the stern virtue of our ancestors, by the virtue of their
descendants it shall be preserved.</p>

<p>“Since, therefore, the misdeeds of your Majesty’s ministers in
violating the freedom of Election, and depraving the noble constitution
of Parliaments are notorious, as well as subversive of the fundamental
Laws and Liberties of this Realm; and since your Majesty, both in
honour and justice, is obliged inviolably to preserve them according
to the Oath made to God and your subjects at your Coronation; we,
your remonstrants, assure ourselves that your Majesty will restore
the constitutional Government and quiet of your people, by <small>DISSOLVING</small>
this Parliament, and removing those evil ministers <span class="smcap">FOR EVER</span> from
your councils.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This manly and righteous remonstrance was presented
after many pettifogging slights and indignities, vexations,
and subterfuges on the part of the Court and Crown; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
there were made various attempts to bring into discredit
the authenticity of this document as the expression of
the Court of Aldermen. The Corporation of the city, in
sixty carriages, proceeded with the various officers to the
palace of St. James’s, and were received by the king on
his throne. The remonstrance was read; and, in reply,
His Majesty read an answer, drawn up in advance, condemning
both the former petition and the present remonstrance
in unmistakable terms, and ending with an assurance
that “he had ever made the law of the land the rule
of his conduct, esteeming it his chief glory to rule over a
free people;” and then, descending into more palpable
falsehoods, asserting, in the face of facts, with a power of
dissimulation worthy of Charles II:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“with this view I have always been careful, as well to execute
faithfully the trust reposed in me, as to avoid even the appearance
of invading any of those powers which the Constitution has placed
in other hands.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The king was evidently the puppet of more vicious
minds, being blessed with but a feeble reasoning faculty
of his own. After reading his equivocative answer, and as
the lord mayor and the city representatives were withdrawing,
the vacuity of his intellect made itself manifest&mdash;for
it is asserted in contemporaneous accounts, “His Majesty
instantly turned round to his courtiers, and <i>burst out laughing</i>.
<span class="smcap">Nero fiddled while Rome was burning.</span>”</p>

<p>The reception accorded to these petitions being far
from such as their gravity demanded, fresh agitations
commenced in the metropolis and in the provinces, and,
on March 30th, Horne Tooke delivered a remarkable address
to the freeholders of the county of Middlesex, in which
he graphically described both the murders he had seen
committed and the conduct of the justices of the peace,
who said the ministerial instructions were for the soldiers
to fire, and referred to the partiality shown on the trials
and the defences made at the expense of Government when
it was endeavoured to bring the guilty to justice. At this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
meeting, “An Address, Remonstrance, and Petition of the
Freeholders of Middlesex” was drawn up for presentation,
in which it was urged on the king&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“that a secret and malignant influence had thwarted and defeated
almost every measure which had been attempted for the benefit of
his subjects, and had given rise to measures totally subversive of the
Liberties and Constitution of these once flourishing and happy
kingdoms.”</p>

<p>“It is not for any light or common grievances that we presume thus
repeatedly to interrupt your Majesty’s quiet with our complaints. It
is not the illegal oppression of an individual; it is not the partial
invasion of our property; it is not the violation of any single law of
which we complain, but it is a violation which at one stroke deprives us
of the only constitutional security of our Fortunes, Liberties, and Lives.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty’s servants have attacked our Liberties in the
most vital part; they have torn away the heart-strings of the Constitution,
and have made those men our destruction, whom the laws have
appointed as the immediate guardians of our Rights and Liberties.</p>

<p>“The House of Commons, by their determination at the last
election for this county, have assumed a power to overrule at pleasure
the fundamental <i>Right of Election</i>, which the Constitution has placed
in other hands, those of their Constituents, and from whence alone
their whole authority is derived; a power by which the law of the land
is at once overturned and resolved into the will and pleasure of a
majority of one House of Parliament. And if this pretended power
is exercised to the full extent of the principles, that House can no
longer be a Representative of the people, but a separate body, altogether
independent of them, self-existing, and self-elected.</p>

<p>“These proceedings have totally destroyed the confidence of your
Majesty’s subjects in one essential branch of the legislative power,
and if that branch is chosen in a manner not agreeable to the laws
and constitution of the kingdom, the authority of Parliament itself
must suffer extremely, if not totally perish.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The remonstrance from which the above paragraphs
are extracted was, together with a petition from the
county of Kent, presented to His Majesty at St. James’s;
both being received and handed to the lord of the bedchamber
in waiting; <i>but no answer was returned</i>.</p>

<p>The electors of the city of Westminster also drew up
a similar “Address, Remonstrance, and Petition”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“their former application to the throne having been ineffectual,
and new and exorbitant grievances being beyond patient endurance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
By the same secret and unhappy influence to which all our grievances
have been originally owing, the redress of those grievances has been
now prevented; and the grievances themselves have been repeatedly
confirmed; with this additional circumstance of aggravation, that
while the invaders of our rights remain the directors of your Majesty’s
councils, the defenders of those rights have been dismissed from your
Majesty’s service&mdash;your Majesty having been advised by your
ministers to remove from his employment, for his vote in Parliament,
the highest officer of the Law (Lord Camden), because his principles
suited ill with theirs, and his pure distribution of justice with their
corrupt administration of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>“We beg leave, therefore, again to represent to your Majesty that
the House of Commons have struck at the most valuable liberties and
franchises of all the electors of Great Britain; and by assuming to
themselves a right of choosing, instead of receiving a member when
chosen, and by transferring to the representative what belonged to the
constituent, they have taken off from the dignity, and, we fear,
impaired the authority of Parliament itself.</p>

<p>“We presume again, therefore, humbly to implore from your
Majesty the only remedies which are in any way proportioned to the
nature of the evil; that you would be graciously pleased to dismiss
<i>for ever</i> from your councils those ministers who are ill-suited by their
dispositions to preserve the principles of a free, or by their capacities
to direct the councils of a great and mighty kingdom; And that by
speedily dissolving the present Parliament, your Majesty will show
by your own example, and by their dissolution, the rights of your
people are to be inviolable, and that you will never necessitate so
many injured, and, by such treatment, exasperated subjects, to
continue the care of their interests to those from whom they must
withdraw their confidence; to repose their invaluable privileges in
the hand of those who have sacrificed them; and their trust in those
who have betrayed it.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>“We find ourselves compelled to urge, with the greatest importunity,
this our humble but earnest application, as every day seems
to produce the confirmation of some old, or to threaten the introduction
of some new injury. We have the strongest reason to apprehend
that the usurpation begun by the House of Commons upon the right
of electing, may be extended to the right of petitioning, and that
under the pretence of restraining the abuse of this right, it is meant
to bring into disrepute, and to intimidate us from the exercise of the
right itself.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The representatives elected by the people had done
their utmost, as respected the venal majority, to betray
their trust and those who had sent them to the Commons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Resistance was countenanced, and, by counter-addresses to
the throne, the king was prejudiced against listening to
the wishes of the people. This remonstrance elicited his
Majesty’s reply “<i>that he would lay it before his Parliament</i>;”
a curious conclusion, inasmuch as his afflicted subjects
specially prayed therein that the king would be their
safeguard against the majority in that body, who had
betrayed the nation, and to the deliberation of that
corrupted assembly the complaint&mdash;which affected the
duration of the House&mdash;was to be submitted for redress!
The remonstrance, which resembled an impeachment of
the administration, was, in fact, handed to the ministers
under accusation, to be by them resisted, prosecuted, or
rendered ineffective at their discretion. The indignant
judgments enunciated by “Junius” against these unprincipled
politicians, foes to the kingdom, have been
abundantly confirmed by the verdict of posterity.</p>

<p>The reception otherwise accorded to the Westminster
remonstrance was altogether undignified. When the
deputation, headed by Sir Robert Bernard, who had been
returned member for that city by the unanimous suffrage
of the constituency, arrived at the palace gate, an extra
guard of soldiers was immediately turned out, not, however,
as a compliment, for&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“although there was not the least appearance of anything disorderly,
yet the soldiers behaved in a most insolent manner, and
struck many persons with their bayonets, and that without provocation.
The Gentlemen having alighted from their carriages, amidst
the acclamations of the people, walked through the lane of soldiers,
and went upstairs to the Levee Room door, where they were met by
one of the Grooms of the Bedchamber, who asked Sir Robert Bernard
if he had anything to present to his Majesty? To which Sir Robert
replied, ‘Yes, the Address, Remonstrance, and Petition of the City
of Westminster.’ Upon which the Groom of the Bedchamber said,
‘He would go and acquaint the Lord-in-Waiting.’ He went immediately,
but not returning soon, Sir Robert Bernard proposed to
go into the Levee Room, which he did. On opening the door, the
same Groom of the Bedchamber said he could not find the Lord-in-Waiting;
but should soon. However, the Gentlemen went on, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
after some time the Lord-in-Waiting came to them, and said, if they
had anything to deliver to his Majesty, he would receive it in the next
room, whither they accordingly went; and after some time, his
Majesty coming into the room, Sir Robert presented the Remonstrance
open. His Majesty delivered it to the Lord-in-Waiting, who delivered
it to another, who handed it to the Groom of the Bedchamber, and he
carried it off.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The recreant majority of the Commons, still at the
bidding of degraded ministers, continued to address the
king with counter-petitions intended to bring into disrepute
the remonstrances of the people&mdash;those very constituents
who had chosen them as the defenders of their
liberties.</p>

<p>Finally, another effort was made by the city, and a
general assembly was held for that purpose, when the chief
magistrate, the Court of Aldermen, and Common Council
resolved to renew their petition, and further to consider
the king’s “answer.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A motion was then made, that the thanks of this Court be given
to Lord Chatham for his late conduct in Parliament, and for his zeal
shown for the most sacred Rights of Election and of petitioning, and
for the promise of his endeavours to support an independent and more
equal representation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On a motion denouncing the most unbecoming treatment
which the city of London had of late experienced from
his Majesty’s ministers, it was suggested to draw up the
strongest remonstrance possible on the violated right of
election. Upon which, Alderman Wilkes, remarking upon
the peculiar delicacy of his situation, said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“that he would not mention a syllable about the person excluded;
but if the House of Commons could seat any gentlemen among them
who was not chosen by the people, the constitution was torn up by the
roots, and the people had lost their share in the legislative power;
that the disabling any person from sitting in Parliament, who was not
disqualified by law, was an injury to every County, City, and Borough,
and a dissolution of the form of government established by law in this
Kingdom.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The recorder cavilled at certain spirited expressions in
the drawing-up of the remonstrance, particularly respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the king’s answer, which he declared could not be
considered an act of the ministers, but must be held to
be the king’s personally. The committee was shocked
at the recorder’s bringing home to the king one of the
most unconstitutional acts of his ministry, and without
one dissentient voice determined to overrule the objection
of the recorder, whereon this functionary protested against
the remonstrance in strong terms as a <span class="smcap">Libel</span>. Alderman
Wilkes then rose and mentioned his unwillingness to speak
again, but he was forced to it by the recorder’s declaration
that the remonstrance was a libel; that he too claimed
to know something of the nature of a libel; that he did
not speak from theory only, but had bought much experience
on that subject; that the remonstrance was
founded throughout on known and glaring facts, every
word bearing the stamp of truth; that the particular act
complained of in the violated right of election was a
malicious and wilful act of the majority in the House of
Commons, for the minister had declared, that “if any
person had only four votes for Middlesex, he should be
the sitting member for the county!” The lord mayor,
Beckford, confirmed Wilkes’s assertion, concluding, “I was
then present in the House of Commons.”</p>

<p>The remonstrance was accordingly presented; in it
astonishment was expressed at the censure lately passed
by the throne upon the faithful and afflicted citizens,
laying their complaints and injuries at the feet of their
Sovereign, as the father of his people, able and willing
to redress their grievances.</p>

<p>The concluding paragraph was very much to the purpose,
and displayed no diminution of firmness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Your Majesty cannot disapprove that we here assert the clearest
principles of the constitution against the insidious attempts of evil
counsellors to perplex, confound, and shake them. We are determined
to abide by those rights and liberties, which our forefathers bravely
vindicated, at the ever-memorable Revolution, and which their sons
will ever resolutely defend. We therefore now renew, at the foot of
the throne, our claim to the indispensable right of the subject&mdash;a full,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
free, and unmutilated Parliament, legally chosen in all its members;
a right which this House of Parliament have manifestly violated,
depriving, at their will and pleasure, the county of Middlesex of one
of its legal representatives, and arbitrarily nominating, as a Knight of
the Shire, a person not elected by a majority of the freeholders. As
the only constitutional means of reparation now left for the injured
electors of Great Britain, we implore, with most urgent supplications,
the dissolution of the present parliament, the removal of evil ministers,
and the total extinction of that fatal influence which has caused such
national discontent.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, Sire, we offer our constant prayers to Heaven,
that your Majesty may reign, as Kings only can reign, in and by the
hearts of a loyal, dutiful, and free people.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To this remonstrance the king’s answer was:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I should have been wanting to the public as well as to myself, if
I had not expressed my dissatisfaction at the late Address. My sentiments
on that subject continue the same; and I should ill deserve to
be considered as the father of my people, if I could suffer myself to be
prevailed upon to make such an use of my prerogative as I cannot but
think inconsistent with the interest and dangerous to the constitution
of the kingdom.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After His Majesty had been pleased to make the foregoing
answer, the lord mayor requested leave to reply,
which, being granted, Beckford made the dignified and noble
response which is a matter of history:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(“If worth allures thee, think how Beckford shone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who dar’d to utter Truths before the throne.”)<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“Most Gracious Sovereign&mdash;Will your Majesty be pleased so far to
condescend as to permit the Mayor of your loyal City of London to
declare in your Royal presence, on behalf of his fellow-citizens, how
much the bare apprehension of your Majesty’s displeasure would at
all times affect their minds. The declaration of that displeasure has
already filled them with inexpressible anxiety, and with the deepest
affliction.</p>

<p>“Permit me, Sire, to assure your Majesty that your Majesty has
not in all your dominions any subjects more faithful, more dutiful,
or more affectionate to your Majesty’s person and family, or more
ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in the maintenance of the
true honour and dignity of your Crown.</p>

<p>“We do, therefore, with the greatest humility and submission,
most earnestly supplicate your Majesty, that you will not dismiss us
from your presence without expressing a more favourable opinion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
your faithful citizens, and without some comfort, without some prospect
at least of redress.</p>

<p>“Permit me, Sire, further to observe, that whoever has already
dared, or shall hereafter endeavour by false insinuations and suggestions,
to alienate your Majesty’s affections from your loyal subjects
in general and from the city of London in particular, and to withdraw
your confidence in and regard for your people, is an enemy to your
Majesty’s person and family, a violator of the public peace, and a
betrayer of our happy Constitution, as it was established at the glorious
revolution of 1688.”</p></blockquote>

<p>At the conclusion of these expressions of enlightenment
for the royal mind, the lord mayor waited more than a
minute for a reply of “some more favourable opinion,” but
none was given.</p>

<p>“On this occasion,” says the satirist, “Nero did <i>not</i>
fiddle while Rome was burning.” The humility and serious
firmness with which the dignified Beckford&mdash;who enjoyed
the friendship of the great Earl of Chatham, and with
whom he had many points in common&mdash;uttered these words,
“filled the whole Court with admiration and confusion;”
for they found very different countenances amongst the
citizens than they expected from Lord Pomfret’s description,
who declared in the House of Lords&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“that, however swaggering and impudent the behaviour of the low
citizens might be on their own dunghill, when they came into the
royal presence, their heads hung down like bulrushes, and they blinked
with their eyes like owls in the sunshine of the sun.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 19th of May, the king prorogued that parliament
which, by approving addresses from both Houses, had
fortified the royal censure returned to the popular remonstrances.
“The prevalence of animosities and of dissensions
among their fellow-subjects” was specially alluded
to in his Majesty’s speech, while the conduct of both
branches of his legislature received in return such flattering
encomiums as their servile pliability had earned by despicable
means:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The <i>temper</i> with which you have conducted all your proceedings
has given me great satisfaction, and I promise myself the happiest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
effects from the firmness, as well as the moderation, which you have
manifested in the very <i>critical</i> circumstances which have attended your
late deliberations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However undignified the reception accorded at the time
to these petitions addressed to the throne from its truest
supporters, the good cause eventually triumphed, in defiance
of the chicanery of counter-expressions of servility, fabricated
at the instance of those whose prospects depended on
the continuance in power of false politicians, despising
alike the voice and interests of the people, and resting their
reliance on the venality of their adherents, and the base
instinct of self-aggrandisement at the expense of the state
existent in minds equally mercenary with their own.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Eventually the citizens succeeded, in spite of the united efforts
of the Court, the Ministers, and the Parliament; and their cause has
since been solemnly and universally recognized as that of the Constitution
and of liberty. It is impossible to appreciate too highly the
national importance of the conduct they pursued.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was well said by “Junius,” the integrity of whose
sentiments bears more than a casual resemblance to the
utterances of that patriotic statesman, Lord Chatham, with
whose fame the authorship of Junius’s “Letters” may one
day be identified:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The noble spirit of the metropolis is the life-blood of the state,
collected at the heart; from that point it circulates with health and
vigour through every artery of the Constitution.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The great Chatham and his friend, William Beckford,
stand out conspicuous from their fellow-men in association
with that corrupt time when statescraft was for the most
part a question of ability for debasing the largest number
on the easiest terms contrivable; they lived at a time when
liberty ran especial risks, and, as champions of popular
rights, proved worthy of those emergencies with which
they were confronted. In days when the chief magistrate
of the city may degenerate to a subservient courtier, the
history of Beckford’s firm attitude may be regarded as no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
longer the worthiest part of the civic traditions. That his
fellow-citizens appreciated his exertions is shown by the
thanks he received for his able and dignified speech to the
king; his reply was ordered to be inserted in the city
records, and afterwards, at his death, was inscribed on the
monument erected in the Guildhall to his memory.</p>

<p>The blow struck at a corrupt administration by the
Westminster and other remonstrances seems to have
damped the ardour of the ministers; in any case, no Court
candidate was put forward for Westminster in 1770, and
consequently the election of a liberal candidate was unopposed.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April, at noon, came on at St. Paul’s,
Covent Garden, the election of a representative in parliament
for the City and Liberty of Westminster, in the room
of the Hon. Edwin Sandys, created Lord Sandys. A considerable
number of the electors assembled early in the
morning at the “Standard Tavern” in Leicester Fields;
and proceeded from thence with a band of music, etc., in
procession through Piccadilly to the residence of Sir Robert
Bernard, in Hamilton Street. When they came to Covent
Garden, the whole square was full. Proclamation of silence
being made, Sir John Hussey Delaval, Bart., addressing
himself to the people, said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“he rejoiced to see such a prodigious number of the Electors
present, to support the nomination in Westminster Hall the previous
Thursday; that Sir Robert Bernard had stood forward in support of
the rights of the people in their just complaints against the late flagrant
violation of their liberties; and concluded with observing, that they
were come to confirm with their votes this their free and glorious
choice.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Lord Viscount Mountmorres seconded the motion in a
spirited speech, in which he stated&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“the services and principles of Sir Robert Bernard; the grievances
under which the people laboured; the great violation of their rights
in the case of Middlesex; the impossibility that any king, that any
parliament, that the courts of justice, or that all together, could annihilate
the people’s constitutional rights.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p></blockquote>

<p>These speeches were received with acclamation by the
twenty thousand people present, amongst whom strict good
order was preserved.</p>

<p>The proper proclamations being made, and no other
candidate appearing, the return was signed by the gentlemen
present on the hustings. The election being entirely
over, the gentlemen retired into the vestry-room, where the
indenture was signed by them, and finally returned to the
Crown Office. On the day following, Sir Robert Bernard
was introduced into the House of Commons by the Hon.
Henry Grenville and William Pulteney, and took his seat
as member for Westminster. The Westminster returns
being generally looked upon with interest by other constituencies,
this election was held out as a proper example
to every city in the kingdom, and to all the counties and
towns, to choose their members with a spirit of freedom and
without expense. It was resolved by the freeholders of
Westminster, in advance&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“that if this election had been contested, it would not have cost
Sir Robert Bernard a shilling, the electors being determined to support
their free choice.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This particular return is a case in point, which goes
to prove that the authors of corruption in electioneering
matters were more guilty than those they corrupted. At
the Covent Garden hustings&mdash;where, on previous occasions,
the ministers had spent enormous sums, besides moving
every power and art of intrigue to get their own nominees
returned&mdash;the entire proceedings were one long scene of
bribery, trickery, and illegality, brute-force, and disorder.
On the occasion in question, 1770, the administration seems
to have been slightly cowed by the results of their ill-advised
manœuvres to impose placemen upon the county:
the recent Middlesex proceedings were still a source of
concern; the constitution had been violated&mdash;not with
impunity,&mdash;and serious effects in the way of impeachment
were by no means impossible: consequently, the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
being left to the legitimate exercise of their liberties, the
election passed off in the pacific, well-ordered, and regular
manner described, freedom did not degenerate into licence,
“no one was a penny the worse,” and the representative
system in its purity of action was for once maintained in
Westminster.

<span class="medium">REMARKABLE ELECTIONS AND CONTROVERTED ELECTION
PETITIONS, 1768 TO 1784.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The feats of the Whartons, Walpoles, Marlboroughs,
Pelhams, and Graftons, in the direction of lavishing large
sums for the corruption of the electorate, were dwarfed into
insignificance by the fortunes staked upon a single contest
later on: thus the disbursements over a contested election
at Lincoln would be twelve thousand per candidate; and,
we are told, “occasionally, after a hard fight at such places
as Colchester, all the defeated men appeared in the <i>Gazette</i>.”
It is stated that the two great county contests for Hampshire,
in 1790 and 1806, cost the ministerial candidates
twenty-five thousand apiece on each occasion, while their
opponent’s expenses were proportionately large. The
contest, still remembered by Northampton worthies as the
“Spendthrift Election,” in which three earls fought for
the borough election in favour of their respective nominees
in 1768, is a startling instance of the lengths to which
electioneering Peers were tempted to proceed in “scot and
lot times.” The opponents were the Earls of Halifax, Northampton,
and Spencer, and the respective nominees they
pitted against each other in this all but ruinous “tourney”
were Sir George Osborne, Sir George Bridges Rodney, and
the Hon. Thomas Howe. The candidates were of small
account in the conflict; their patrons bore the brunt of
the battle. The canvassing commenced long before the
polling; this was extended over fourteen days&mdash;a phenomenal
circumstance in the days when elections were often
settled and returns made before ten o’clock on the morning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
of the polling day. According to the poll-book, the
legitimate number of electors, some 930, was exceeded by
288, but confusion of persons is accounted for by the
promiscuous hospitalities of three noble mansions being at
the mercies of the crowd for weeks: at the famous historical
seats of Horton, Castle Ashby, and Althorp, the
orgies pictured in Hogarth’s “Election Dinner”&mdash;“filled
with the tipsified humours” of what Bubb Dodington fitly
called, “venal wretches”&mdash;were indefinitely prolonged.
“The Scot and Lot,”&mdash;woolcombers, weavers, shoemakers,
labourers, pedlars, militia-men, and victuallers held “high
revel,” prolonged without intercession from night till
morning, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, in the ancestral halls, of which,
including the well-stocked wine-cellars, they were in a body
“made free.” Therein lodged the perdition of Horton; for,
after they had drained dry the goodly stock of matured
port, Lord Halifax had to place before them his choicest
claret, whereon, with one accord, filled with vinous fastidiousness,
the “rabble rout” deserted to a man, declaring,
“they would never vote for a man who gave them sour
port,” and went over in a body to Castle Ashby. Each of
the candidates claimed more votes than could be legally
registered in his favour. Howe, the unsuccessful candidate,
whose “potwallers” and “occasional voters” were likewise
challenged, petitioned; and the “controverted
election” came before the House of Commons. During
the six weeks the scrutiny lasted, sixty covers were daily
spread at Spencer House, St. James’s, for those concerned in
the case. The results were no less eccentric: the number of
votes being finally found equal, the election was referred
to chance, and decided by a toss, which Lord Spencer won,
and nominated a man out in India. The cost of this
escapade then had to be counted. It is said Lord Spencer
expended one hundred thousand pounds; his antagonists
are credited with having wasted one hundred and fifty
thousand pounds each&mdash;an incredible sum, considering this
represents at least double the equivalent amounts at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
present day. Earl Spencer came off lightest, and appears
to have been in no way involved; Lord Halifax was
ruined; Lord Northampton cut down his trees, sold his
furniture at Compton Winyates, went abroad for the rest of
his days, and died in Switzerland. Canon James, who has
related the story of the famous “Spendthrift Election” in
his “History of Northamptonshire,” mentions that at
Castle Ashby is still preserved a sealed box, labelled
“Election Papers,” the evidence of this insane contest&mdash;one
of no political moment; but none of the present
generation has had the courage to open the dread
receptacle of bygone folly.</p>

<p>A whimsical anecdote is related by Edgeworth, in his
“Memoirs,” respecting the contest for Andover at the
general election in 1768, when Sir J. B. Griffin was
returned at the head of the poll with seventeen votes; the
second member was B. Lethieulier, with fifteen votes; and
the defeated candidate was Sir F. B. Delaval, who only
polled seven. The latter was a celebrity, both in fashion
and in the politics of his day, and the story which is connected
with his electioneering experience properly belongs
to the traditions of the subject. Sir Francis found himself
at loggerheads with his attorney, an acute practitioner,
whose bill had been running for years, and, though considerable
sums of money had been paid “on account,” a
prodigious balance was still claimed as unsettled; this Sir
Francis disputed at law. When the case came before the
Court of King’s Bench, amongst an exorbitant list of
charges the following item excited general attention:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To being thrown out of the George Inn, Andover; to my legs<br /></span>
<span class="i4">being thereby broken; to surgeon’s bill, and loss of time<br /></span>
<span class="i4">and business; all in the service of Sir F. B. Delaval    &pound;500.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was found that this charge required explanation.
It appeared that the attorney, by way of promoting the
interests of his principal in the borough, had sought to
propitiate the favour of those important potentates at
electioneering times, the mayor and corporation, in whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
hands, as seen in the foregoing, was vested so much of the
local influence. A pretext was necessary to decoy these
worthies to a banquet, where they might be conciliated,
so the attorney sent cards of invitation to the mayor and
corporation in the name of the colonel and officers of a
regiment in the town; he at the same time invited the
colonel and staff, in the name of the mayor and corporation,
to dine and drink the king’s health on his birthday;&mdash;an
ingenious <i>ruse</i>, but the arch-diplomatist had literally
“reckoned without his host.” The two parties met, were
cordially courteous, ate a good dinner, toasted his majesty’s
health, and proceeded to other oratorical compliments
before breaking up. Then came the acknowledgments:
the commanding officer of the regiment made a handsome
speech to Mr. Mayor, thanking him for his hospitable
invitation and entertainment; “No, Colonel,” replied the
mayor, “it is to you that thanks are due, by me and my
brother-aldermen for your generous treat to us.” The
colonel replied with as much warmth as good breeding
would allow; the mayor retorted in downright anger,
vowing that he would not be choused by the bravest
colonel in His Majesty’s service. “Mr. Mayor,” said the
colonel, “there is no necessity for displaying any vulgar
passion on this occasion; permit me to show you that I
have here your obliging card of invitation.” “Nay, Mr.
Colonel, here is no opportunity for bantering, there is your
card.” The cards were produced simultaneously. Upon
examining the invitations, it was observed that, notwithstanding
an attempt to disguise the hand, both cards were
written by some person who had designed to hoax them all.
Every eye of the discomfited guests, corporation and
officers alike, turned spontaneously upon the attorney,
who had, of course, found it necessary to be present to
flatter the aldermen; his impudence suddenly gave way,
he faltered and betrayed himself so fully by his confusion,
that, in a fit of summary justice, the colonel threw him out
of window; for this, Sir F. B. Delaval was charged &pound;500.

<p>Among the parodies of election addresses issued at the
time of the rival Shelburne and Rockingham parties, is
a broadside “embellished” with a copperplate engraving
of a whimsical assembly of citizens, met in solemn conclave
to examine the political views of a deformed sweeper-lad,
“a public character,” who, it appears, was nicknamed
by his contemporaries “Sir Jeffery Dunstan.” The pointed
satire is thus headed:&mdash;</p>

ELECTORS OF THE ANCIENT BOROUGH OF GARRATT,</h3>

ETC., ETC., ETC.</h4>

<h5>“‘A tous ceux &agrave; qu’il appartiendra.’&mdash;<span class="smcap">Voltaire.</span>” (Otherwise “to all
whom it concerns.”)</h5>

<p class="noindent">The candidate’s address is one of those confused harangues
in which a number of subjects are incongruously involved
together, known in later days as “a stump oration.” Among
other subjects, Dr. Graham’s “celestial beds,” recruiting for
the army, polygamy, and divorce, “the delicate brave men
of the association” (volunteer force), and an “effete
nobility,” are all mixed up according to the following
sample:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As my honourable friend Mr. Burke cannot lessen the influence
of the Crown, myself and his grace of Richmond are determined to
accomplish it, by abolishing the use of money entirely; it being
irrevocable poison to men’s souls, and the only remedy existing to
prevent Bribery and Corruption; an evil which all the learned gentry
of Westminster Hall could never annihilate; and I do faithfully
declare, being no placeman, that I will not waste my fleeting moments
like the four city members, whose elements of oratory what Roman
senator could ever equal.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The address rambles through a variety of absurdities,
and concludes with a quotation from Rusted’s “Poems.”
Whoever that worthy may have been, his lines have a fine
air of burlesque grandiloquence, sense being subordinated
to sound:&mdash;

broadsides which it delighted Miss Banks to accumulate.
It will be remembered that eccentric lady was
sister to Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal
Society, and one most instrumental in founding the British
Museum, to which his collections and those of his sister
were left. Among Miss Banks’s “Political and Miscellaneous
Broadsides” is another electoral appeal to the
same fanciful constituency; the document otherwise seems
almost a literal copy of an actual address of the day:&mdash;</p>

<h3>“TO THE NOBILITY, GENTRY, CLERGY, AND FREEMEN

<p>“N.B.&mdash;His Lordship’s colours are Blue and Orange.</p>

<p class="center">
“⁂ Carriages will be ready on the Day of Election.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Those corrupted electors of Shoreham who resolved themselves
into a purchasable community on their own account,
were roughly handled by the parliamentary inquisitors, but
the avowed and professional traffickers in venal boroughs
seemed to conduct their trade openly, and, with the great
parliamentary lights, unadmonished and unexposed. They
were generally the agents of those who had secured the influence
in the seats by various methods&mdash;some by inheritance,
others by patronage, sometimes by purchase <i>en bloc</i>, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
generally <i>en d&eacute;tail</i>. Men invested in boroughs and cultivated
them for sale, secure of a profitable mart when
the proper season arrived; the burgage-houses were bought
and accumulated; “shambles on old foundations” carrying
voting qualifications were secured; burgage tenures were
bought up; voters were pensioned from year to year, the
process varying according to the nature of the suffrage.
As in the case of Sheridan’s expenses at Stafford, the
independent electors were retained at a settled price per
head. Sheridan’s cost him five guineas per burgess; Wilberforce
found four guineas the price at Hull for a plumper.
Southey says it rose to &pound;30 a vote at Ilchester, Somerset,
where the burgesses had a direct control over their borough;
although the tariff ran high, the four candidates who recklessly
bribed the constituents in 1774 lost their pains and
money, petitions and counter-petitions establishing that
the members returned and those who alleged they were
unjustly rejected were alike so palpably culpable of corruption
that the election was declared void. In 1826,
Ilchester is given in the “Manual” as under the patronage
of Sir W. Manners. Irrespective of the local and lesser bargains
made with the mayors and burgesses, there was the
“big business” conducted on behalf of the actual individual
landholders of the place&mdash;those magnates set down in the
election lists of constituencies as “patrons” of boroughs,
the dispensers of seats.</p>

<p>For an instance of the facility which characterized the
<i>modus operandi</i>, though “the prices ruled high” owing to
extraneous demands, see the “Letters” of that skilled courtier,
Lord Chesterfield, deeply versed in political chicanery
and combination. In a passage of a letter dated Bath,
December 19, 1767, he writes to that hopeful youth who by
“Chesterfield’s Letters” was to be polished into a fine
gentleman, and for whom a place in Parliament was a
desirable opening&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In one of our conversations here this time twelvemonth I desired
my Lord Chatham to secure you a seat in the new parliament. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
assured me he would, and, I am convinced, very sincerely....
Since that I have heard no more of it, which made me look out for
some venal borough; and I spoke to a borough-jobber, and offered
five and twenty hundred pounds for a secure seat in parliament; but
he laughed at my offer, and said that there was no such thing as a
borough to be had now, for the rich East and West Indians had secured
them all, at the rate of three thousand pounds at least, but many at
four thousand, <i>and two or three that he knew at five thousand</i>. This,
I confess, has vexed me a good deal.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Much has been said about “Old Sarum” (Wilts) as
being typical of the unabashed and confirmed borough-mongering
and corruption which existed not only in the
last century, but, in fact, until the larger measure of Reform
carried in 1832. Representative government, conducted
on the principles which prevailed in “hole-and-corner
boroughs” until the passing of that bill against which even
Sir Robert Peel protested as a dangerous innovation,
certainly, for the most part, had but a theoretic existence,
as a review of the facts sufficiently demonstrates. Amongst
the statistics given in Stockdale’s “Parliamentary Guide”
(1784), Dr. Willis writes that the borough of Old Sarum
was then reduced to <i>one house</i>. It returned members
in 23 Edw. 1, and then intermitted until 34 Edw. 3,
since which time representatives were returned until its
disfranchisement. These were at first elected in the
county-court, as was then customary; from 1688, the
right of election was in “the freeholders being burgage-holders”
and the number was <i>seven</i>. In 1826, when the
last parliament of George IV.’s reign assembled, this state
of things was unaltered, the patron was the Earl of Caledon,
and the mysterious seven remained. New Sarum, otherwise
Salisbury, which had taken the place of “Old Sarum,”
received its privileges by letters patent, 2 Hen. 3, which
conferred on the bishops and canons <i>tanquam proprium
dominicum</i>; afterwards confirmed by charter 34 Edw. 1.
In 1784, there were about fifty-six voters; the right of
election being “in the select number, that is, the mayor
and corporation.” The Earl of Radnor and G. P. Jervoise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
were the patrons in 1826, when Viscount Folkestone and
Wadham Wyndham were returned by the fifty-four electors
then set down as the suffrage-holders.</p>

<p>Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, was another scandalous and
typical “pocket-borough” which obtained notoriety, especially
at the time of the passing of Lord Grey’s Reform Bill,
Sir Charles Wetherell being turned into satiric capital by
Doyle (HB), in his versions of the “Last of the Boroughbridges.”
The right of election was in the burgage-holders&mdash;a
“pocket-borough” tenure, thus denounced by Charles
James Fox: “If a man comes into parliament as the
proprietor of a burgage tenure, he does not come there
as the representative of the people,” as explained in the
eloquent speech of the great Whig chief, on Grey’s motion
for Reform, 1797. The Duke of Newcastle was the patron,
and sixty burgage-holders returned two members. The
constituency of Helston, where the franchise was originally
invested in a corporation, under the Old Charter, had in
1790 dwindled down to one elector, to whose lot it fell to
nominate two representatives.</p>

<p>The case of a “controverted election” at Hindon, Wilts,
where the right of election was of an easy order, viz.
“inhabitants of houses within the borough, being housekeepers
and parishioners, not securing alms,” raised an
altogether pretty scandal in the way of revelations on
corrupt treating. The sitting members, returned in 1774,
being Richard Smith and T. Brand Hollis, the unsuccessful
candidates, James Calthorpe and Richard Beckford, were
the petitioners on the ground that the former, by the
bribery of themselves and their agents, had procured an
illegal return. On the hearing of the petition it was
discovered that all or the major part of the voters for all
four candidates had been bribed, and the committee
pronounced the election void. The candidates themselves
had not only bribed, but thirteen electors, acting as agents,
had also been employed to corrupt their fellow-voters. The
committee resolved to disfranchise these electors:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A bill was then ordered to incapacitate from voting at elections
of members of parliament 190 persons, besides the thirteen above-mentioned,
out of 210 who had polled at the election.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">These persons appealed against the bill, and there being
technical objections to the petitioners “being parties to
and alike defendants in an indictment,” it was argued they
“could not, without overturning the known rules of law
and justice, be received as witnesses in this case.” By
a tacit agreement the unfortunate cross-petitions were
dropped the ensuing session, and two new writs were issued;
meanwhile the attorney-general, on separate informations,
proceeded against the four candidates (June, 1775) for
bribery at elections, held to be a crime at common law
independent of any statute against it. All the four informations
were tried at the Lent assizes in the county of Wilts,
March, 1775, before Baron Hotham. The two petitioners
who were in the first instance responsible for this scrutiny
were acquitted; Smith and Hollis, who had been returned,
were found guilty, and were brought up to the Court of
King’s Bench to receive judgment: this was on the 20th of
May, the last day of the term, and the judges desiring time
to consider the proper punishment, they were committed
till the next term to the King’s Bench prison. Meanwhile,
previous to this commitment, the new election for Hindon
had taken place (May 16th), and Mr. Richard Smith was
again returned. On the 7th of June, Smith and Hollis were
again brought up for judgment, when they were each fined
1000 marks<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and sentenced to prison for six months, and
until they paid their respective fines; and it was ordered
that Richard Smith should give security for his good
behaviour for three years, himself in the sum of &pound;1000, and
two sureties each of &pound;500.</p>

<p>A flagrant instance of boroughmongering was exposed
during a parliamentary investigation into a case of controverted
election at Milborne Port, Somerset, where the
right of voting was, amongst others, in the capital bailiffs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
and their two deputies. The petition proposed to disqualify
eleven votes upon the score of “occasionality,” and to
object to eleven who voted for the sitting members and
were disabled by a corrupt bargain made between Mr.
Medlycott, the senior member, and Loyd, an agent of Lord
North’s. There were nine bailiwicks in the borough, with
a bailiff appointed for each. Mr. Medlycott had long been
in possession of four of these, and the remaining five
belonged to the family of Walters. A remarkable example
of downright trading appeared as the case developed. In
February, 1770, Loyd arrived at Milborne Port as the
friend of Lord North. A meeting was held at Yeovil
between the agent and the patron, two or three others
being present, at the house of one Daniel; where a contract
was duly drawn up, signed, and witnessed, by which
Medlycott agreed to sell the borough, and to throw out
his old friend, the Hon. Temple Luttrell, who was one
of the persons presenting the petition, which revealed the
underground workings of administrative jobbery. The
writing drawn up at Yeovil purported to be the “memorandum
of an agreement to defray the expenses of procuring
a seat in parliament for any friend of Lord North,
whom his lordship or Loyd should recommend.” To this
end Loyd agreed to deposit fifteen hundred pounds in
Daniel’s hands, to be employed in purchasing the family
interest of the Walters in the remaining five bailiwicks for
the use and at the risk of Medlycott, who stipulated to pay
Loyd five per cent. for the money so advanced, until such
time as Lord North’s friend should be seated peaceably
fourteen days in parliament&mdash;the time allowed for petitioning.
The paper was put into Lord North’s hands, who
returned it to Daniel, without committing himself to any
observation. On the faith of this instrument&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“The Walters’ property in the voters was transferred; the five
bailiffs were nominated, and consigned to Medlycott’s interest, thus
purchased by Loyd. But the patron of the borough, on assuming the
undivided influence therein, in the spirit of friendship wrote to his
colleague Luttrell on the subject, acknowledged this foul transaction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
and urged the wretched excuse <i>that his poverty, and not his will,
consented</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The counsel for the petitioners further said they would
give evidence of the bribery, and several offers made, also
of the <i>treats</i> given to influence the voters. The ministerial
influence seems to have been paramount on this occasion;
as the committee determined, in the face of the absolute
documentary evidence, and other proofs of bribery, treating,
illegal voting, and refusal to register legitimate votes on
behalf of the petitioners, that the gentleman who had sold
the seat in the borough to Lord North was&mdash;with the
second ministerial nominee, brought in by his venality&mdash;duly
elected. This borough of Milborne Port seems to have
been a snug haven for nominees: in 1826 the patronage
was at the joint disposal of the Marquis of Anglesea and
Sir W. Coles Medlycott, and returned the Hon. Berkeley
Paget and Lord Graves&mdash;proving the utility of “a stake in
the country.” The warming-pan constituency was swept
away, with similar anomalies, by the Reform Bill carried
by Lord Grey.</p>

<p>In the general election of 1774 the contest for Westminster
was marked by the unblushing exertion of much
undue influence. Not only did two ducal houses bring all
the weight of their purses and ministerial influence, adding
to almost limitless resources such strong inducements as
the Duke of Northumberland, with his metropolitan
patronage, and the Duke of Newcastle, with his placemen,
pensions, and ministerial patronage, could bring to bear for
the return of younger scions of the two houses concerned;
the royal authority was freely used, and the king’s servants,
without, it was shown, any qualifications as voters, were
allowed to record their voices for the return of the Court
candidates. The famous election of 1784, although stronger
in incident, must have been tame by comparison. Not
only members of the royal household, but divers peers of
the realm and lords of parliament publicly canvassed,
and otherwise unduly interfered in the election, contrary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
several express resolutions of the House. The candidates
stood thus at the close of the poll:&mdash;Earl Percy, 4995; Lord
Thomas Pelham Clinton, 4744; Lord Mountmorres, 2531;
Charles Stanhope, Lord Mahon, 2342; and Humphrey
Cotes, 130. A petition was presented by Lord Mountmorres
and several electors of the city and liberty of Westminster
against the return of Earl Percy and Lord T. P. Clinton,
seeing that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“the king’s menial servants, not having proper houses of their
own within the city of Westminster, gave voices in the said election,
contrary to an express resolution of the House; that peers and lords
unduly interfered and tampered with the voters; that during the
election, after the <i>teste</i> and issuing out of the writ, Lord Percy and
Lord Thomas Pelham Clinton, by themselves or agents, were guilty of
bribing, corrupting, and entertaining the voters, (who must have made
a fairly good thing of the contest); and that they allowed to the
electors, and several persons who had or claimed a right to vote, money,
meat, drink, entertainment, or provision; and that by those, and
other undue means, a majority of votes was procured for Lord Percy
and Lord T. P. Clinton, so that they were returned, and the petitioners
prayed such relief as upon examination should appear just.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As bribery commissions were then constituted, the party
in power generally managed to make disputed returns a
means of strengthening their own majority, so that
although the House took the pains to examine the several
allegations, it was decided that the sitting members were
duly elected.</p>

<p>On the respective counts it was found that there was
no general determination as to the right of election in
Westminster, but it seemed agreed that the suffrages were
vested “in the inhabitants, householders, paying scot and
lot;” that the king’s menial servants, not having proper
houses of their own within the city of Westminster, were
not entitled to vote&mdash;as they had done, on the pretence of
being residents in the royal palaces of St. James and
elsewhere. It was admitted that the following resolution,
providing against the interposition of peers in elections for
the Commons, had been renewed on the opening of the
House, from session to session, since the Act was made,
January 3, 1701:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Resolved that it is a high infringement of the liberties and
privileges of the Commons of Great Britain for any lord of parliament
or any lord-lieutenant of any county to concern themselves in the
elections of members to serve for the Commons in parliament.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The petitioners set forth that it would appear, by
different allegations, that the rights of the election had
been invaded in a manner highly alarming, so as to call
for the interposition and censure of the House; but the
report of the committee disposed of these objections by
finding the petitioners were not able to prove any direct
solicitation of the peers.</p>

<p>A similar objection was raised on the same general
election as to the legal return of the sitting members for
Worcester,&mdash;that a peer and lord of parliament had, by
himself and his agents, interfered in the election by
publicly canvassing and soliciting votes, and by using
threats to intimidate freemen from voting for the petitioner,
in violation of the privileges of the House and the
freedom of election, and to the infringement of the rights
of the Commons of Great Britain. Moreover, there was
an allegation of bribery, and that conducted on a wholesale
scale. The mayor, aldermen, and justices of the city, the
town-clerk and many of the common council had sworn in,
for several days before and during the election, many freemen
(some hundreds) to be constables, under a promise
that they would vote for the candidates chosen by the
persons so influencing them, “for which they were to have
certain rewards in money;” and that this money was
afterwards paid to them out of the funds of the city, or by
the two sitting members.</p>

<p>In transparent cases of bribery, when the committee of
the “whole House” serving on these “controverted elections”
decided to retain and confirm the sitting members,
there seems to have been a convenient formula much
resorted to in silencing those petitions brought on the
grounds of corruption; for instance, after the general
elections of 1774,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“An objection was taken to the petitioners examining any witness
as to the payment, till they should first bring proof of the agency. It
was argued that the circumstances which would establish both points
were so complicated that they could not be separated;”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><i>ergo</i>, all evidence on the points to be proved was technically
excluded, and the petition was stultified.</p>

<p>It seems, also, to have been not unusual for high sheriffs
to return themselves; for instance, in the controverted
election case for Abingdon, Berks, March, 1774-5. The
petitioner set forth that the member returned was then
high sheriff for the county of Berks; his counsel arguing,
“that by an express clause in the writ of election the choice
of sheriffs is prohibited; and that this clause has made
part of the writ for three centuries.” It was admitted
that Sir Edward Coke, sheriff of Buckinghamshire, had
been returned for Norfolk in the second year of Charles I.,
and that he sat till the dissolution of that parliament;
but his right was questioned, and in the “Journals and
Debates” he is invariably described as a member <i>de facto</i>.
It was contended in reply, on the other side, that the sheriff
was justified in his return, the wording of the writ not
being taken literally, in any case such as “knights girt
with a sword;” that Mr. Child, being sheriff of Warwickshire,
was chosen and returned for Wells, in the county of
Somerset; he was petitioned against, but was declared duly
elected. It was also stated, on behalf of the controverted
sitting member, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“since the statute of the 23rd Henry VI., the sheriff is in no respect
the returning officer for boroughs; he is obliged to accept the return
sent him, with his precept, and is merely the conduit-pipe to convey it
to the clerk of the crown.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The counsel for the member whose return was impeached
further observed that if sheriffs could not be chosen
members of parliament, the Crown would be able to
prevent any one from being elected, by taking care to make
him a sheriff before the election; by which means, in bad
times, every friend to the rights of the people might be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
excluded from sitting in the House of Commons. On this
occasion, as the high sheriff had returned himself, that is
to say, for his own county, it was thought proper to decide
that the election was void; thus, at the same time, disqualifying
the petitioner as well, which, was seemingly
unreasonable.</p>

<p>There were two petitions presented in reference to the
controverted election at Morpeth, Northumberland, in
1774. On this occasion it was violence and intimidation
more than corrupt and illegal practices&mdash;though all had
been resorted to&mdash;which had unjustly influenced the return.
The candidates were the Hon. William Byron, Francis
Eyre, T. C. Bigge, and Peter Delme.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was proved by a number of witnesses, that, at the end of the
Poll, the majority was declared to be in favour of Delme and Byron
(a counter-petition set forth that a majority had been obtained for
Delme by the corrupt practices of Byron), but that the returning
officers were <i>compelled</i> to return Delme and Eyre: and it was also
proved that, on the morning of the election, before it began, Eyre
made an inflammatory speech to the people; that after the riot began,
he having retired some time before, the returning officers sent him
word they would return whom he pleased, and that an answer being
brought them, that they must return himself and Mr. Delme, they
complied, and the riot ceased.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The decision of the committee was that the gentleman
who, as master of the mob, had directed the storm, was
<i>not</i> duly elected, while the Hon. W. Byron, who had found
his way to the suffrages of the voters through their pockets,
must be returned, together with his nominee, Delme,
already seated.</p>

<p>At Petersfield, Hants, in 1774, the Hon. John Luttrell
was unfortunate, and brought a petition against the two
members returned, Sir Abraham Hume and William Jolliffe,
the former being high sheriff for the county of Hertford,
and both&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“having been guilty of divers acts of bribery, by money, meat,
drink, reward, entertainment, and provision; and that James Showell,
pretending to be mayor, had acted partially.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Three or four witnesses were called to prove that gifts and
promises had been made by Mr. Jolliffe in the presence of
the other sitting member; in the course of this evidence&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“one Newnam was called to prove a declaration made to him
by Brackstone a voter, about having got the promise of a <i>house</i> from
Mr. Jolliffe for his vote.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The committee resolved that the evidence was inadmissible
on the grounds that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“although the declaration (not upon oath) of a person who cannot
be obliged to be a witness on the subject himself, is admissible in
evidence to <i>affect such person</i>, yet is not admissible <i>against a third
party</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Although the traditional figure of “Punch” is associated
with punishments dealt out indiscriminately, it
appears in the old electioneering days he was the agent
for distributing illicit rewards for iniquitous acts. In
the case of a “controverted election” for the borough of
Shaftesbury (Dorset) the evidence produced vividly recalls
Hogarth’s representation of an election broadside, “Punch,
Candidate for Guzzletown,” introduced in his picture of
“Canvassing for Votes.” After the general election, 1774,
it was alleged that the sitting members, Sykes and Rumbold,
by themselves or their agents, had been guilty of
bribery, while it was attempted to be shown that Mortimer,
who was the petitioner, had promised money to procure
his election. The trial lasted four weeks, and among the
points of evidence was the following indictment against
the manœuvres of “Punch:”&mdash;Money, to the amount of
several thousand pounds, had been given among the
electors,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> in sums of twenty guineas a man (654 votes
were recorded in 1774; 532 being for Sykes and Rumbold).
The persons who were entrusted with the distribution of
this money, and who were chiefly the magistrates of the
town, fell upon a very singular and absurd contrivance,
in hopes of being able thereby to hide through what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
channel it was conveyed to the electors. A person concealed
under a ludicrous and fantastical disguise, and
called by the name of “Punch,” was placed in a small
apartment, and, through a hole in the door, delivered out
to the voters parcels containing the twenty guineas; upon
which they were conducted to another apartment in the
same house, where they found a person called “Punch’s
secretary,” and signed notes for the value, but which were
made payable to an imaginary character, to whom they
had given the name of “Glenbucket.” Two of the
witnesses, called by the counsel for the petitioner, swore
that they had seen “Punch” through the hole in the door,
and that they knew him to be one Matthews, an alderman
of Shaftesbury; and, as the counsel for the petitioner had
endeavoured to prove, an agent for the sitting members.
It was said that those voters who admitted that they had
received “Punch’s” money, had at the poll taken the
bribery oath; it was contended for the other side that
this was not legal evidence, that “it would be unjust to
suffer what a man had said in conversation, and without
an oath, to invalidate what he had solemnly sworn.” The
committee determined that, with regard to supposed
agents, evidence should be first produced to establish the
agency, before the bribery by such persons should be gone
into. In the sequel it was determined that the two sitting
members were not duly elected, and that the petitioner
should be returned. “Punch,” his exertions, and his
profuse distribution of bribes proved a grievous failure.</p>

<p>Not only was bribery freely practised under one or
another disguise, but even the result of the petitions and
scrutinies were made the subject of corruption. In a
controverted election for Sudbury, in 1780, for instance,
the question was put to the committee, “Whether a person
who had laid a wager of about &pound;40 on the event of the
petition was competent to give evidence in the cause?”
the decision being in the affirmative. This Sudbury
election was altogether an odd affair.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The mayor was the returning officer, and the petitioner alleged
that at the close of the poll it was declared in his favour, but that
afterwards a scrutiny was illegally demanded, when the other candidates
were pronounced duly elected.” It was given in the evidence
“that the election began Sep. 8, 1780, about ten o’clock in the
morning, and continued until it was dark: that the petitioner and
his friends then desired the mayor to adjourn the poll to the following
day; but that he refused, and proceeded all night by candlelight”&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">the election ending between six and seven o’clock the
following morning: “There was some tumult during a
part of the poll, but that it was upon the whole a very
peaceable election.” This goes far to prove that an election
must have been an extraordinarily turbulent business a
century back, when proceedings varied by “a tumult
during part of the poll” was admitted to be peaceful in
an unusual degree.</p>

<p>The Shaftesbury arrangements for presenting voters with
packets of twenty guineas were outdone by the electors of
Shoreham, who combined and resolved themselves into a
joint-stock company, that they themselves might derive
the advantage from their borough which in other cases was
monopolized by the patrons, or holders of bailiwicks. The
suffrages being originally in the mayor and burgesses,
these electors, with a forethought superior to their
generation, organized themselves into a compact league,
or caucus, for electioneering purposes; but <i>not</i> with the
intention of resisting and keeping out corrupt practices:
the nature of this compact was disclosed during the hearing
of the petition of Thomas Rumbold, on the election of a
member in place of Sir Samuel Cornish deceased, and is
set down in the <i>Journals</i> of the House (vol. 33), 1770-1.
It appeared that the petitioner was duly elected, those who
voted for him, to the number of eighty-seven, taking the
bribery oath; as to the other candidates, thirty-seven votes
were given for Purling and four for James; but the
returning officer placed queries against the names of
seventy-six of the petitioner Rumbold’s voters, and immediately
on the close of the poll declared Purling duly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
elected. The fourth plea related that in this borough of
Shoreham had subsisted for many years a body which had
assumed the name of the “Christian Society,” though its
organization was quite outside the diffusion of benevolence
or Christianity; none but electors for representatives in
parliament were admitted into the society, but the great
majority of those who had votes were enrolled. A clerk
was employed, and a meeting-place provided, where regular
monthly and frequent occasional meetings were held, upon
which gatherings a flag was hoisted to give notice to the
members. About 1767, the members of the society entered
into articles for raising and distributing small sums of
money for charitable uses, these articles being designed to
cover the real intention of the institution. The principal
purpose of their meetings was for what they denominated
<i>burgessing business</i>. An oath of secrecy was administered
to all the members, who farther entered into a bond, under
a penalty of five hundred pounds, to bring them all together
with regard to <i>burgessing</i>; but otherwise the conditions of
the bond were not allowed to appear. Upon any vacancy
in the representation of the borough, the society always
appointed a committee to <i>treat with the candidates for the
purchase of the seat</i>, and the committees were constantly
instructed <i>to get the most money and make the best bargain
they could</i>; the society had no other purpose in view, and
had no standing committee. On a false report of the death
of the sitting member, Sir Samuel Cornish, the society
was called together by the signal of the flag. On that
meeting, which was numerously attended, the members
declared that <i>they would support the highest bidder</i>; but
some of their number, including Hugh Roberts, the
returning officer impeached in the petition, expressed
themselves offended at such a declaration, and declared
that they were afraid of the consequences, for the society
was nothing but <i>a heap of bribery</i>, and withdrew from the
body; but two months later, one of these ex-members
returning to a meeting of the society, was treated with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
harsh expressions, and was told he came among them as
a spy. The society, however, continued to meet, their
gatherings being more frequent near election time. It
was said that, on the death of Sir Samuel Cornish, when a
vacancy occurred, a committee was appointed to treat for
the seat with the incoming candidate, the members of the
said committee themselves being careful to abstain from
voting, though they were there on the day of election;
three days before the polling, the society was reported to
be dissolved, in order to escape the odium of proceedings
on petition, but that the meetings had been resumed
since. In the face of this evidence, Mr. Purling’s counsel
acquainted the court “that he could not carry his case
further than by the witnesses examined, and could not
impeach Mr. Rumbold’s election or affect his votes.”
Although this closed the petitioning case, it was resolved
that a further inquiry ought to be made into the transactions
of the society, and a bill was ordered “to incapacitate
certain persons from voting at elections,” together with an
address to the king to order the attorney-general to
“prosecute certain persons for an illegal and corrupt
conspiracy in relation to the late election for Shoreham.”
The bill was carried, printed, copies served on the offenders,
passed through the House, agreed to by the Lords,
and received the royal assent. The returning officer was
ordered into the custody of the serjeant-at-arms; he was
finally brought to the bar of the House to be reprimanded
and discharged.</p>

<p>New Shoreham appears later under the patronage of
the Duke of Norfolk and Earl of Egremont; the suffrage
in 1771, after the extraordinary federation described in the
foregoing, was extended to forty-shilling freeholders, “in the
rape of Bramber,” in which Shoreham is situated.</p>

<p>R. B. Sheridan, the brilliant but unstable genius,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> sat
for Stafford from 1780, until that ill-considered attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
to represent the city of Westminster in the place of his
deceased friend, the great Charles James Fox, which
completed his financial ruin. “Sherry” was notorious
for looseness in his accounts, and it is curious to find one
of the few circumstantial statements of election outlays
calculated upon this unbusinesslike representative’s
borough expenses for the first parliament in which he
represented Stafford&mdash;always a moderate place, as prices
ruled,&mdash;Sheridan being brought in chiefly by the influence
of the shoemakers, an extensive body there.</p>

(Moore’s “Life of Sheridan,” vol. i. p. 405.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>In 1806, when R. B. Sheridan was, by a coalition with
Sir Samuel Hood, elected for Westminster&mdash;a seat lost by
him, to his ruin, on the unexpected dissolution the year
following,&mdash;his son, Tom Sheridan, that “proverbial pickle,”
whose love of mischief and readiness of resource were alike
remarkable, was offered for election in his gifted father’s
place; the reputation of the Sheridans was, however, on the
wane, and Tom, though admirable and even unapproachable
at the hustings, was hardly endowed with the sterling
qualities which should be found in a representative of the
people to the Commons. The electors made choice of two
Tory candidates, R. M. Phillips (412), and the Hon.
E. Monckton (408), leaving but a poor record of votes for
Thomas Sheridan (165). An amusing instance is recorded
of the good-will of the constituents on this occasion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When Mr. Clifford introduced Mr. R. M. Phillips to the electors&mdash;the
journeymen shoemakers, as a token of respect, insisted that they
should present him with a new hat, which was accordingly done, on
the hustings, by a contribution of one penny each.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Truly an exceptional circumstance, when voters&mdash;although
expectant to receive&mdash;were rarely prepared to bestow,
even their “voices,” unless for an adequate consideration!</p>

<p>The first entry into public life of William Pitt, as
related by Earl Stanhope, is characteristic of the easy
mode of procedure in those days, when a great man had
merely to name his friends, and his tenants elected them.
“Hitherto,” wrote Sir George Savile in 1780, “I have been
elected in Lord Rockingham’s dining-room. Now I am
returned by my constituents.” The spirit of the country, it
was asserted, was rising at that period, but in 1780, it was
still manifest that the territorial magnates and the monopolists
of the borough franchises had their “own sweet will.”
Pitt’s early friend, the eldest son of that Granby who had
been an attached follower of Lord Chatham, had, mindful
of this hereditary friendship, sought the acquaintance of
William Pitt at the beginning of the latter’s career at
Cambridge. Granby was five years Pitt’s senior; he became
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
one of the members for Cambridge University, and
in 1779 had the fortune to succeed his grandfather as
Duke of Rutland. On Pitt’s coming to London, to commence
his career, the young men became intimate, and the
warm attachment between them, which continued during
the whole of the duke’s life, was the cause of the early
advancement of the son of the great Commoner. Owing
to the Duke of Rutland’s solicitude to see Pitt in parliament,
he spoke upon the subject to Sir James Lowther,
another ally of his house, and the owner of most extensive
borough influence. Sir James quickly caught the idea,
and proposed to avail himself of a double return for one
of his boroughs to bring the friend of his friend into
parliament. The duke mentioned the offer to Pitt; and
Pitt, who was writing on the same day to his mother,
Lady Chatham, added a few lines in haste to let her know.
But it was not until he had seen Sir James himself that he
was able to express his entire satisfaction at the prospect
now before him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
“Lincoln’s Inn, Thursday Night, Nov., 1780.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,</p>

<p>“I can now inform you that I have seen Sir James Lowther,
who has repeated to me the offer he had before made, and in the
handsomest manner. Judging from my father’s principles, he concludes
that mine would be agreeable to his own, and on that ground&mdash;to
me of all others the most agreeable&mdash;to bring me in. No kind
of condition was mentioned, but that if ever our lines of conduct
should become opposite, I should give him an opportunity of choosing
another person. On such liberal terms I could certainly not hesitate
to accept the proposal, than which nothing could be in any respect
more agreeable. Appleby is the place I am to represent, and the
election will be made (probably in a week or ten days) without my
having any trouble, or even visiting my constituents. I shall be in
time to be spectator and auditor <i>at least</i> of the important scene after
the holidays. I would not defer confirming to you this intelligence,
which I believe you will not be sorry to hear.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is added (Dec. 7, 1780),&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have not yet received the notification of my election. It will
probably not take place till the end of this week, as Sir James
Lowther was to settle an election at Haslemere before he went into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
the north, and meant to be present at Appleby afterwards. The
parliament adjourned yesterday, so I shall not take my seat till after
the holidays.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">This confidence discloses that such a thing as a contest, let
alone a defeat, was not for a moment entertained.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I propose before long, in spite of politics, to make an excursion
for a short time to Lord Westmoreland’s (Althorp, Northamptonshire),
and shall probably look at my constituents that should have been, at
Cambridge, in my way.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">About three years later, William Pitt, by that time the
most conspicuous statesman of his day, and already prime
minister of England by the royal will, on the downfall of
the coalition, realized his former ambition, and he offered
himself successfully for the University of Cambridge. In
order to enter for this distinction, Pitt had declined two
seats, voluntarily placed at his disposal: when the war-cry
arose from the hustings throughout the kingdom, he was
put in nomination, without either his knowledge or consent,
for the city of London, as usual the first election
in point of time; the show of hands was declared to be
in the young statesman’s favour, but when apprised of the
fact he declined the poll. Such were the honours heaped
upon this proud juvenile premier, that he was constantly
refusing favours solicitously placed at his acceptance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He was pressed,” says Earl Stanhope, “to stand for several
other cities and towns, more especially for the city of Bath, which
his father had represented, and the king was vexed at his refusal
of this offer. But the choice of Pitt was already made. He had
determined, as we have seen, to offer himself for the University of
Cambridge.”</p></blockquote>

<p>He held at this time all the state patronage, and, moreover,
with the king at his back, he meant mischief to the
members of the ministry recently displaced from power by
his royal master; and was about to trust to his faculties
and the reserve forces he could command for a great
electioneering campaign. He found time to write to his
friend in Yorkshire:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Wilberforce</span>,</p>

<p>“Parliament will be prorogued to-day and dissolved to-morrow.
The latter operation has been in some danger of delay by
a curious manœuvre, that of stealing the Great Seal last night from
the Chancellor’s, but we shall have a new one ready in time. I send
you a copy of the Speech which will be made in two hours from the
Throne. You may speak of it in the past tense, instead of in the
<i>future</i>.... I am told Sir Robert Hildyard is the right candidate for
the county. You must take care to keep all our friends together, and
to <i>tear the enemy to pieces</i>. I set out this evening for Cambridge, where
I expect, notwithstanding your boding, to find everything favourable.
I am sure, however, to find a retreat at Bath.</p>

<p class="author">
“Ever faithfully yours,<br />
“<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Though Pitt had the “good things” to give away he
did not escape sarcasm: thus it was suggested&mdash;it is said
by Paley, who was then at Cambridge&mdash;as a fitting text
for a university sermon, “There is a lad here which
hath five barley loaves and two small fishes; but what
are they among so many?”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The author of this pleasantry,” declares Stanhope, “did not
allow for the public temper of the time; in most cases the electors
voted without views of personal interest; in some cases they voted
even against views of personal interest.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Pitt was supported by Lord Euston, the heir of the
Duke of Grafton, and between them they defeated the late
members, the Hon. John Townshend, and James Mansfield,
both members of the coalition ministry, the former
as lord of the admiralty, the latter as solicitor-general.
After a keen contest, Pitt and Lord Euston were returned,
Pitt at the head of the poll. It was a marked triumph, and
exercised an influence elsewhere; nor was it a fleeting
victory or a temporary connection, for Pitt continued to
represent the university during the remainder of his life.
Pitt, now, as he called himself, “a hardened electioneerer,”
entered into the spirit of the warfare, and carried his forces
into the strongholds of the Whig estates:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“But,” writes Earl Stanhope, “of all the contests of this period
the most important in that point of view was for the county of York.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
That great county, not yet at election times severed into Ridings,
had been under the sway of the Whig Houses. Bolton Abbey, Castle
Howard, and Wentworth Park had claimed the right to dictate at the
hustings.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The spirit of the country in 1784 rose still higher;
the independent freeholders of Yorkshire boldly confronted
the great Houses, and insisted on returning, in
conjunction with the heir of Duncombe Park, a banker’s
son, of few years and of scarcely tried abilities, though
destined to a high place in his country’s annals&mdash;Mr.
Wilberforce. With the help of the country gentlemen, they
raised the vast sum of &pound;18,662 for the expense of the
election (twenty-one years later this “vast sum” would
not have produced much effect on the same field, when
Wilberforce fought, in 1807, what has been described as
the “Austerlitz of electioneering,”&mdash;the candidates between
them expending above three hundred thousand
pounds,&mdash;the details of which follow in their chronological
sequence); and so great was their show of numbers and of
resolution, that the candidates upon the other side did not
venture to stand a contest. Wilberforce was also returned
at the head of the poll by his former constituents at Hull.
“I can never congratulate you enough on such glorious
success,” wrote the youthful prime minister to his equally
youthful friend. Rank and file, leaders and spokesmen,
of the coalition party fell before the masterly tactics of the
young chief, who stirred the minds of the people by extreme
views as to England’s sinister future (if the Whigs prevailed)
menaced with the onslaught of sweeping revolutions,
and the destruction of every moderate institution and
every safeguard of the state. In this manner, writes Pitt’s
biographer, the party of the opposition was scattered beyond
rallying. “To use a gambling metaphor,” declares Stanhope,
“which Fox would not have disdained, many threw
down their cards. Many others played, but lost the rubber.”
A witty nickname was commonly applied to them. In
allusion to the History, written by John Fox, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
sufferers under the Romish persecution, they were called
“Fox’s Martyrs;” and of such martyrs there proved to be
no less than one hundred and sixty. Amidst all these
reverses, however, Fox’s high courage never quailed. On
the 3rd of April, we find him write as follows to a friend:
“Plenty of bad news from all quarters, but I think I feel
misfortunes when they come thick have the effect rather
of rousing my spirits than sinking them;”&mdash;as set down
by Earl Russell in his “Memorials.”</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of the great
electioneering contest of 1784 was the fact of the ex-demagogue
Wilkes being returned as the ministerial
candidate, to Pitt’s pronounced gratification too, for the
county of Middlesex. But the ways of statesmen are
indeed wonderful and manifold, and Wilkes, the man
without prejudices, and equally unburdened by principles,
was an expedient ally (though a redoubtable foe). Wilkes,
very cleverly and plausibly, upon the score of Pitt’s constant
advocacy of Parliamentary Reform, was enabled to press
upon the freeholders of the county of Middlesex the
advisability of extending their entire support to the
“virtuous young Minister,” whose “liberal and enlightened
principles promised to advance the best interests of the
country.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Wilkes having made the most of his patriotism, after
being elected lord mayor, and subsequently obtaining
the lucrative and permanent office of city chamberlain,
now exhibited himself in his true colours&mdash;a remarkable
instance of tergiversation, disclaiming his own acts, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
making no scruple of expressing his contempt for the
opinions of his former supporters. On his return for
Middlesex in 1784, as one of “the
king’s friends,” the democrats represented
the king and Wilkes hanged
on one tree, with the inscription,
“Give justice her claims.” The reconciliation
of the “two kings of
Brentford” was by no means popular,
and the wits were severe on the fresh
departure. One of these caricatures,
May 1, 1784, is entitled, “The New
Coalition.” It represents the King
and the ex-archdemagogue fraternally
embracing; Wilkes’s cap of liberty is
cast to the ground; he declares to his
Sovereign, “I now find you are the
best of princes.” While great George
discovers the erst agitator, his late aversion, “Sure! the
worthiest of subjects and most virtuous of men!”</p>

<p>Charles James Fox, the most popular Whig statesman
of history, was returned for Midhurst in May, 1769. He was
then only nineteen years and four months old; notwithstanding
this, he took his seat the November following,
thus becoming a member of parliament before he reached
the age of twenty. Curiously enough, his first speech,
March, 9, 1770, was on a point of order, arising out of the
Wilkes case and the disputes of the Middlesex election.
In spite of his affected patriotism, Wilkes made a jest of
his insincerity: standing on the hustings at Brentford, his
opponent said to him, “I will take the sense of the
meeting;” to which the pseudo “champion of liberty”
responded, “And I will take the nonsense, and we shall see
who has the best of it.” In the same way he coolly disavowed
his friend and advocate Serjeant Glynn, his
colleague for Middlesex, who had fought all his battles
through the courts to the hustings, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
years later, as related by Earl Russell, when the “two
kings of Brentford” were excellent friends, and Wilkes,
by the irony of fate, became a ministerial candidate, he
was received at a lev&eacute;e, when George III., with his habitual
practice of asking awkward questions, inquired after
Wilkes’s friend, Glynn. “Sire,” said Wilkes, “he is not a
friend of mine; he was a Wilkite, which I never was.”</p>

<p>One of the most animated pictures which can be found
of the humours of canvassing is that drawn from life by
William Cowper, at the time the poet’s mind was influenced
to cheerfulness by the company of the lively Lady Austen,
who, with the more gravely solicitous Mrs. Unwin, made
Olney an halcyon abode. The year the “Task” was
published, and while Cowper was touching up his spirited
ballad of “John Gilpin,” he has set down the visit of an
aspiring young senator, no less than Pitt’s cousin, Mr. W. W.
Grenville, who, with a retinue of zealous supporters at his
tail, quite “without your leave,” bursts upon the poet’s
retirement in pursuit of suffrages; this was at the general
election of 1784:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As, when the sea is uncommonly agitated, the water finds its
way into creeks and holes of rocks, which, in its calmer state, it never
reaches; in like manner, the effect of these turbulent times is felt even
at Orchard Side, where in general we live as undisturbed by the
political element as shrimps or cockles that have been accidentally
deposited in some hollow beyond the water-mark by the usual dashing
of the waves. We were sitting yesterday after dinner, the two ladies
and myself, very composedly, and without the least apprehension of
any such intrusion, in our snug parlour; one lady knitting, the other
netting, and the gentleman winding worsted, when, to our unspeakable
surprise, a mob appeared before the window, a smart rap was heard at
the door, the boys halloed, and the maid announced Mr. Grenville.
‘Puss’ [Cowper’s tame hare] was unfortunately let out of her box, so
that the candidate, with all his good friends at his heels, was refused
admission at the grand entry, and referred to the back door as the only
possible way of approach. Candidates are not creatures to be very
susceptible of affronts, and would rather, I suppose, climb in at the
window than be absolutely excluded. In a minute, the yard, the
kitchen, and the parlour were filled. Mr. Grenville, advancing
towards me, shook me by the hand with a degree of cordiality that was
extremely seducing. As soon as he, and as many more as could find

chairs, were seated, he began to open the intent of his visit. I told
him I had no vote, for which he readily gave me credit. I assured him
I had no influence, which he was not equally inclined to believe, and
the less, no doubt, because Mr. Ashburner, the draper, addressing
himself to me at this moment, informed me that I had a great deal.
Supposing that I could not be possessed of such a treasure without
knowing it, I ventured my first assertion by saying that, if I had any,
I was utterly at a loss to imagine where it could be, or wherein it
consisted. Thus ended the conference. Mr. Grenville squeezed me
by the hand again, kissed the ladies and withdrew. He kissed likewise
the maid in the kitchen, and seemed, upon the whole, a most loving,
kissing, kind-hearted gentleman. He is very young, genteel, and
handsome. He has a pair of very good eyes in his head, which not
being sufficient, as it should seem, for the many nice and difficult
purposes of a senator, he has a third also, which he wore suspended by
a riband from his button-hole. The boys hallooed, the dogs barked,
‘Puss’ scampered, the hero with his long train of obsequious followers
withdrew. We made ourselves very merry with the adventure, and,
in a short time, settled into our former tranquillity, never probably to
be thus interrupted more.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be added that this persuasive young politician,
W. W. Grenville, succeeded in securing his return at the
top of the poll for the county of Buckinghamshire in 1784,
as Pitt wrote to James Grenville (Lord Glastonbury)&mdash;“William
was safe.”</p>

<span class="medium">THE GREAT WESTMINSTER ELECTION OF 1784.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The excitement caused by Wilkes’s election for Middlesex
in 1768 was forgotten in the great Westminster contest of
1784. Although on each occasion the conflicts were in
opposition to those ministerial interests which enlisted the
Crown, the courtiers, and the following of placemen, state
pensioners, with both branches of the service upon the
Tory side in antagonism to popular rights and the freedom
of election, in both instances of overstrained influence the
Government had to submit to the mortification of defeat.
The circumstances preceding the Westminster election were
exceptional. The Fox and North Coalition Administration
had, by an overstrained exercise of the royal prerogative,
through a “back-stair” Court intrigue, and by defiantly
unconstitutional means on the part of the king, lost their
hold on power, temporarily&mdash;as they then supposed&mdash;but,
as subsequent events proved, beyond recall.</p>

<p>Fox had introduced his vast measure of reform for
the reconstitution of our Eastern Empire. Passed by the
majority commanded by the Coalition Ministry in the
Commons, the Bill was&mdash;in direct deference to the king’s
written instructions, freely heralded about&mdash;thrown out
on the second reading in the Lords. Fox was feared by
the king and the East India Company alike; it was apprehended
that the great “Carlo Khan” was but beginning
the work of revolution, and that all charters would be in
equal jeopardy if that of the East India House was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
allowed to be revised. The wealth of the company was
put into requisition to hurl from power the ministers who
dared to legislate for the administration of the huge empire
confided to their government; and the king chiefly aimed
at the dismissal of the great Whig chief, against whom
an unreasonable prejudice long continued to exist in the
royal mind. On Fox’s defeat it was left to Lord Temple
to constitute an administration which should satisfy the
king; but although this juncture brought William Pitt to
the front, it was found impossible to carry on the business
of the country, the ministry, too weak to divide, being
beaten on every measure introduced by their rivals; finally,
the opposition majority carried the following damaging
resolution by nineteen votes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“That it is the opinion of this House that the continuance of the
present ministry in power is an obstacle to the formation of such an
administration as is likely to have the confidence of this House and
the people.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">An address to the king in the same spirit was passed,
and similar motions and addresses were repeated until
parliament was prorogued with a discontented speech
from the throne, and it was dissolved on the day following,
March 25, 1874; thus ending for the time this
threatening contest between the Crown and the most
important part of the legislature, and transferring the
arena of conflict to the hustings. By the royal will,
Pitt, though only in his twenty-fifth year, was established
as Prime Minister of England, uniting in himself the offices
of first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer;
his colleagues being those already known as “the
king’s friends,” or youthful aspirants to power willing
to tread in their steps. At the elections, the opposition
laboured under the disadvantage of leaving the patronage
of administration in the hands of their antagonists, and
though the contests were obstinate, the Court influence
and the king’s name, which was used openly in defiance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
of the privileges of parliament, secured a majority of seats
at once, confirming the apprehensions of the Whig party,
and fixing Pitt in security at the pinnacle of power. Horace
Walpole has pictured the feelings of the day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Court struck a blow at the Ministers, but it was the gold of the
East India Company, that nest of monsters (which Fox’s Bill was to
demolish), that really conjured up the storm, and has diffused it all
over England. On the other hand Mr. Pitt has braved the majority of
the House of Commons, has dissolved the existent one, and, I doubt,
given a wound to that branch of the legislature, which, if the tide does
not turn, may be very fatal to the constitution. The nation is intoxicated,
and has poured in addresses of thanks to the Crown for exerting
the prerogative <i>against</i> the palladium of the people. The first consequence
will probably be, that the Court will have a considerable
majority upon the new Elections.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The aversion to the late Coalition Ministry was turned
to account by the Court; the elections showed the opposition,
so strong before the dissolution, in a woeful minority;
the great Whig families, Horace Walpole wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“have lost all credit in their own counties; nay, have been tricked
out of seats where the whole property was their own; and, in some
of those cases, a <i>Royal</i> finger has too evidently tampered, as well as
singularly and revengefully towards Lord North and Lord Hertford....
Such a proscription, however, must have sown so deep resentment
as it was not wise to provoke, considering that permanent fortune
is a jewel that in no Crown is the most to be depended upon.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Westminster election of 1784 was an event of
importance in the political history of the last century; it
was the only serious check that the Court encountered in
the attempt to return a subservient House of Commons;
and circumstances combined to render it the most remarkable
struggle of the kind that has been witnessed. The
metropolis was kept in a state of ebullition for weeks; the
poll was opened on April 1st, and continued without intermission
until May 17th. During this time, Covent Garden
and the Strand were the scenes of daily combats between
the rival mobs; the papers were filled with squibs of the
most personal nature, according to their respective sides in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
politics, and hundreds of pictorial satires appeared on every
incident, and embodying all the successive stages of the
struggle. Rowlandson, who entered with spirit into the
contest, chiefly in the Foxite interests, alone produced on
an average a fresh caricature every day; the best of these
are reproduced in the life of the caricaturist, and a selection
of these subjects, from the work in question, are given
among the present illustrations of the subject. The representatives
of Westminster in the previous parliament were
Fox and Sir Brydges Rodney. Sir Cecil Wray, lately a
follower of the Whig party, had been nominated for the
last parliament by the Whig chief, but on this occasion
Wray ungratefully deserted his political leader, and was
put forward as the ministerial nominee. The king and
Court had resolved to exert every influence to cause Fox’s
defeat on personal grounds. Admiral Lord Hood was also
a Court candidate, but it was Wray who was more especially
held forth as the antagonist of the “Man of the People.”
The political apostate was stigmatized as “Judas Iscariot,
who betrayed his master.” Other charges against him were
certain proposals he is said to have made for the suppression
of Chelsea Hospital and a project for a tax upon
maid-servants; to these were added the general cries
against his supporters of attempting an undue elevation
of the prerogative, and also against the prevalent “back-stair”
influence.</p>

<p>Against Fox was raised the odium of the coalition with
Lord North, and his attack on the East India Company’s
charter was represented as but the commencement of a
general invasion of chartered rights of corporate bodies.
The Prince of Wales interested himself warmly in favour of
Fox, to the extreme provocation of the king and queen; it
was declared that the prince had canvassed in person, and
that the members of his household were actively engaged
in promoting the success of the Whig chief. The exertions
of the Court were extraordinary; almost hourly intelligence
was conveyed to the king, who is said to have been affected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
in the most evident manner by every change in the state of
the poll. Threats and promises were freely made in the
royal name, the old illegalities were revived, members of
the king’s household claimed votes, and on one occasion two
hundred and eighty of the Guards were sent in a body to
give their votes as householders&mdash;an ill-advised manœuvre,
upon which, as Horace Walpole declared, his father, Sir
Robert, would not have dared to venture in the most quiet
seasons. All dependents on the Court were commanded to
vote on the same side as the soldiers. When Fox’s friends,
the popular party, protested against this unconstitutional
interference, their opponents retaliated by charging the
Foxites with bribery, and with resorting to improper influences
of extravagant kinds. Beyond the unpopularity of
relying upon Court patronage and the imputations of
“wearing two faces under a Hood,” and being “a Greenwich
pensioner,” Admiral Lord Hood escaped; the most
bitter party and personal attacks were made upon Wray.
At the beginning of the election, Hood had brought up a
large contingent of sailors, or, as the opposition alleged,
chiefly hired ruffians dressed in sailors’ clothes; these
desperadoes surrounded the hustings, and intimidated Fox’s
friends, and even hindered those who attempted to register
votes in favour of the Whig chief; they grew uproarious as
the poll progressed, and, parading the streets, assaulted
Fox’s partisans, made conspicuous by displaying his “true
blue” favours; they also attacked the Shakespeare Tavern,
where his committee met, when, threatening to wreck the
house, they were beaten off by the inmates. After a reign
of terror, which was endured for four days without
organized resistance, the sailor mob encountered a rival
faction&mdash;entitled the “honest mob” by the opposition
newspapers,&mdash;these were the hackney chairmen, a numerous
body, chiefly Irishmen, almost unanimous in their support
of Fox; these, with hearty will, basted the sailors, breaking
heads and fracturing bones in the neighbourhood of
Covent Garden. The sailors thence proceeded to St. James’s,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
where the chairmen chiefly plied for hire, to wreak vengeance
on their chairs; but the Irishmen beat them again
and the Guards quelled the riot. The day following, both
parties were reinforced. The sailors, vowing vengeance, left
the hustings to intercept Fox on his way to Westminster
to canvass; but he luckily managed to elude them, and
escaped into a private house. The sailor mob returned to
Covent Garden, where they encountered the “honest mob,”
the chairmen being joined by a multitude of butchers,
brewers’ men, and others. A series of pitched battles
ensued, the sailors were defeated at each renewal of the
fighting, and, finally, many of their number being carried
off to hospitals severely injured, the popular rival mob
was left in possession of the field. Special constables were
now introduced at the instance of the justices of the peace,
who were in the Court interest, to surround the places
where Hood and Wray’s committees met, and these behaved
in a manner so hostile to Fox’s party, going about
impeding and insulting Liberal voters, and shouting “No
Fox,” that their presence provoked a fresh outbreak. On
the approach of the “honest mob,” heralded by the sounds
of the marrow-bones and cleavers, the insurrectionary
signal, the constables made an attack, in which one of
their own body was knocked down and killed by fellow-constables
by mistake in the heat of the scuffle.</p>

<p>In Rowlandson’s pictorial versions of the different stages
of this famous election, the public were first excited
against the Coalition Ministry, lately thrown out of office
as described. “They Quarter their Arms” represents
the contracting parties, Fox and Badger, united to share
the Treasury spoils, and battening on the victimized
John Bull; it was “money” which made the Coalition
Wedding:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before the dissolution (March 25th), Pitt’s ministerial
manœuvres were already patent to all. The king had determined,
with the obstinacy of purpose which characterized
the royal mind, that he would endure any sacrifice rather
than sanction the return of the members of the late
Coalition Ministry to power; in the face of this eventuality,
he even threatened, it is stated, to retire to Hanover, but,
in the meanwhile, no effort was spared to obviate this

employed as baits to detach followers of Fox and North.

<p>Jack Robinson, as “Rat-catcher to Great Britain,” is
equipped for his delicate task with a supply of baits, lures,
and traps; round his waist is the “Cestus of Corruption,”
in his pocket is a small aide-de-camp, who is made to
exclaim, “We’ll ferret them out!” On his back is a
double trap, baited with coronets and places; he is cautiously
proceeding on all fours, along the Treasury floor,
where “vermin” are “preserved;” the rats to be captured
are toying with the gold laid down to attract them. To
the nose of one veteran, whose face resembles the spectacled
visage of Edmund Burke, is held a large bait of
“pension,” which is regarded wistfully by other rats
assembled. Under the heading of “Rats of Note,” a
placard on the wall announces the list of political apostates
who have been captured. No concealment was attempted,
for we find in the pages of the <i>Morning Post and Daily
Advertiser</i>, for February 10, 1784, an advertisement, under
the simple heading of “Jack Robinson,” with a woodcut
representing a string of rats, such as might preface a
common rat-catcher’s announcement, giving the names of
twenty-two parliamentary rats already decoyed from their
party allegiance to go over to the good pickings the king
was able to hold out. This curious notification is repeated
on the Treasury wall, shown in Rowlandson’s pictorial view
of the corruption abroad, as a preparation for the coming
elections.</p>

<p>The fact that the public was being treated to the excitement
of perhaps the most momentous and embittered,
if not the hardest-fought election on record, is shown in
Rowlandson’s version of the Covent Garden Hustings,
round which is assembled a crowd of persons who are
being addressed from the platform, whereon stands one
of the ministerial candidates, Admiral Lord Hood, who
is made to announce his intention of carrying “two faces
under a Hood!” This caricature is a pointed comment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
upon the Court manœuvres, and exposes those royal tactics
which had already demoralized the allies of the defunct
Coalition Ministry. Major John Cartwright&mdash;the consistent
and energetic advocate of
reform, of which he was
one of the most valorous
pioneers&mdash;is made the
mouth-piece of the artist’s
satirical strictures, while
endorsing those views held
by “The Drum-Major of Sedition”
(March 29, 1784),
as the liberty-loving
major, who remained conspicuous
in the foremost
ranks of reformers all his
days, was entitled by his
adversaries. A strongly
ironical tendency characterizes
the speech, which may be regarded as a tolerably
pungent electioneering squib:&mdash;</p>

be governed by Prerogative, as they are in France and Turkey.
Gentlemen, the ambition of the enemy is now evident. Has he not,

actually occurred, the great seal being mysteriously carried off on the

<p>Pitt’s valour, then deemed intemperate, in taking up
the reins of office by “the royal will,” and thereby jockeying
the discomfited ex-Coalition Ministry, is commented
upon by Rowlandson in the course of his numerous caricatures
on the great Westminster election. “The Hanoverian
Horse and the British Lion; a scene in a new play,
lately acted at Westminster with distinguished applause.
Act ii., scene last” (March 31, 1784), is a version intended
to be prophetic of the end, a view then warranted by circumstances,
but one falsified by the results of the general
election, which consolidated the power in Pitt’s hands, and
completely left the opposition “out in the cold!” a surprise
by no means anticipated at the date of the cartoon in
question. The Parliament-house is shown as the arena of
this constitutional tournament, and the faithful Commons
are victimized by the aggressive tendencies of Pitt’s steed;
the White Horse of Hanover is trampling upon “Magna
Charta,” the “Bill of Rights,” and mangling the “Constitution.”
Pitt, a remarkably light and boyish jockey, is
exciting the brute, who is neighing, “Pre-ro-ro-ro-ro-rogative”
with vicious energy. The youthful premier is enjoying
the capers of his mount: “Bravo! go it again; I love
to ride a mettle steed. Send the vagabonds packing.”
The heels of the White Horse are effectually scaring the
members and making a clearance. The British Lion has
descended from his familiar post as a supporter of the royal
’scutcheon over the Speaker’s chair; in the vacant space
lately occupied by the British Lion is the announcement,
“We shall resume our situation here at pleasure.&mdash;Leo
Rex.” The sturdy figure of the Whig Chief is safely
mounted upon the British Lion, who is keeping a watchful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
eye upon his Hanoverian rival, while protesting, “If this
horse is not tamed, he will soon be absolute king of our
forest.” Fox has entered on the scene of conflict, armed
for the encounter with bit, bridle, and a stout riding-whip,
to tame and control the uproarious White Horse; he is
volunteering advice to his upstart rival, “Prithee, Billy,
dismount before ye get a fall&mdash;and let some abler jockey
take your seat!” Fox was reckoning without his “Martyrs,”
which the results of the election were destined to
create on an unprecedented scale, as this review will show.
The reverse was shortly to be realized, as set down pictorially
by Rowlandson. The poll was opened April 1, and
three days later appeared a version of Fox as “The Incurable,”
in a strait-waistcoat, and with straw in his hair,
singing:&mdash;</p>

<p>The most active and successful of Fox’s canvassers was
undoubtedly the Duchess of Devonshire, who, by the influence
of her personal charms and her winning affability,
succeeded in procuring for the Whig chief votes which
would never have otherwise been polled in his favour. It
was of the beautiful and winsome Georgiana Spencer, that
Hannay said the Spencers had laid the world under further
obligations by sending forth a second “Fairy Queen,” and
it was the Westminster Election of 1784 which first brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
into celebrity this gay and graceful leader of fashion, who,
by universal suffrage, was the Queen of the Foxites. In
the earlier stages Fox was behind both his opponents, and
although Cecil Wray had only a small majority, Fox was
at his last gasp. The story is told in Wraxall’s “Posthumous
Memoirs” by an eye-witness of the incidents:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The party were driven to new resources, and the Duchess of
Devonshire restored the fates of the Whig champion. The progress of
the canvass thenceforward is amusing. The entire of the voters for
Westminster having been exhausted, the only hope was in exciting the
suburbs. The Duchess instantly ordered out her equipage, and with
her sister, the Countess of Duncannon, drove, polling list in hand, to
the houses of the voters. Entreaties, ridicule, civilities, influence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
all kinds were lavished on these rough legislators; and the novelty of
being solicited by two women of rank and remarkable fashion, took the
popular taste universally. The immediate result was, that they gallantly
came to the poll, and Fox, who had been a hundred behind Sir
Cecil, speedily left him a hundred behind in return. An imperfect
attempt was made on the hostile side to oppose this new species of
warfare by similar captivation, and Lady Salisbury was moved to awake
the dying fortunes of the Government candidate. But the effort
failed; it was imitation, it was too late; and the Duchess was six-and-twenty,
and Lady Salisbury thirty-four! These are reasons enough,
and more than enough for the rejection of any man from the hustings.”</p></blockquote>

Mrs. Hobart, Lady Buckinghamshire, of “Pic-nic” fame,
who, though “fat and fair,” was under “forty,” and remarkably
volatile, but, being of portly figure, this dashing
lady, a connection of Pitt’s, was by the opposition nicknamed
“Madame Blubber,” and the caricaturists, who
represent her as canvassing for Hood and Wray, with a
weighty purse by way of inducement, make the electors on
whom she has tried her persuasive powers unanimous in
asserting “I’m engaged to the Duchess.” Mrs. Hobart
was, however, looked upon as a rival of the gracious
Georgiana, and many satirical shafts, both by verse and
picture, were launched at her full-blown charms. Balloons,
as novelties at that time, were exciting a share of attention,
and Madame Blubber as the “&AElig;rostatic Dilly,” was, as a

convoying to the hustings outlying and dependent voters.</p>

<p>Walpole wrote under date, April 13th:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Fox has all the popularity in Westminster; and, indeed, is so
amiable and winning that, could he have stood in person all over England,
I question whether he would not have carried the parliament.
The beldams hate him; but most of the pretty women in England are
indefatigable in making interest for him; the Duchess of Devonshire
in particular. I am ashamed to say how coarsely she has been received
by some worse than tars. But nothing has shocked me so much as
what I heard this morning. At Dover, they roasted a poor <i>fox</i> alive by
the most diabolical allegory&mdash;a savage meanness that an Iroquois could
not have committed!” “During her canvass the Duchess made no
scruple of visiting the humblest of the electors, dazzling and enchanting
them by the fascination of her manner, the power of her beauty and
the influence of her high rank, and sometimes carrying off to the hustings
the meanest mechanic in her own carriage.”</p>

<p>“The Duchess of Devonshire,” writes Lord Cornwallis, on the 19th
of April, “is indefatigable in her canvass for Fox. She was in the most
blackguard houses in Long Acre by eight o’clock this morning.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The fact of the duchess having purchased the vote of
an impracticable butcher by a kiss is said to be unquestionable.
It was on one of these occasions that the well-known
compliment is said to have been made her by an Irish
mechanic, “<i>I could light my pipe at your eyes</i>.”</p>

<p>Of great beauty and unconquerable spirit, she tried all
her powers of persuasion on the shopkeepers of Westminster,
as Earl Stanhope declares in his “Life of Pitt”:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Other ladies, who could not rival her beauty, might at least follow
her example. Scarce a street or alley which they did not canvass on
behalf of him whom they persisted in calling the ‘Man of the People,’
at the very moment when the popular voice was declaring against
him.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Pitt and his royal patron were, however, exerting every
method to secure the downfall of the redoubtable “Carlo
Khan.” Up to the third day of the polling, “Fox was in a
minority, notwithstanding the immense exertions that were
made on his behalf. The Ministerial Party,” according to
the statement of their own historians, “were sanguine in
the hope of wresting from him the greatest and most
enlightened, as it was then considered, of all the represented
boroughs of England.” Pitt’s proud spirit was
roused at the obstinacy of the contest, and, unlike his more
magnanimous if not greater rival, he lost patience with
his opponents; in a strain of acrimonious pleasantry he
wrote to Wilberforce, “Westminster goes on well in spite
of the Duchess of Devonshire and the other <i>Women of the
People</i>, but when the poll will close is uncertain;” this was
on the seventh day of the poll, and Pitt then little dreamt
of its running for forty days uninterruptedly. By the 23rd
of April, the premier was evidently losing temper, and the
strain of electioneering was becoming tenser, as appears
from a letter written to his cousin, James Grenville, afterwards
Lord Glastonbury:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“Admiral Hood tells me he left Lord Nugent at Bath, disposed
to come to town if a vote at Westminster should be material. I
think from the state of the poll it may be very much so. There is no
doubt, I believe, of final success on a scrutiny, if we are driven to it;
but it is a great object to us to carry the return for both in the first
instance, and on every account as great an object to Fox to prevent it.
It is uncertain how long the poll will continue, but pretty clear it cannot
be over till after Monday. If you will have the goodness to state
these circumstances to Lord Nugent, and encourage his good designs,
we shall be very much obliged to you; and still more, should neither
health nor particular engagements detain you, if, besides prevailing
upon him, you could give your own personal assistance. At all events
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
I hope you will forgive my troubling you, and allow for the importunity
of a hardened electioneerer.... Mainwaring and Wilkes are considerably
ahead in Middlesex, and Lord Grimston has come in, instead
of Halsey, for Herts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Pitt further alludes to W. W. Grenville, his cousin, “the
kissing young gentleman” who visited Cowper in the course
of his canvass, “I have not yet heard the event of Bucks,
but William was safe, and, by the first day’s poll, Aubrey’s
prospect seems very good.” John Aubrey was returned
second, and William Grenville was at the head of the poll.</p>

<p>Fox’s prospects were gradually improved as concerned
his own seat at Westminster; but the slaughter amongst
his followers was altogether unexampled, the muster-roll of
“Fox’s Martyrs” grew ominously longer as each election
was determined. On the twenty-third day of the polling at
Covent Garden the Whig chief passed Sir Cecil Wray, and
continued to advance until the fortieth, when, by law, the
contest closed. On the 17th of May, the poll stood&mdash;Lord
Hood, 6,694; Fox, 6,237; Sir Cecil Wray, 5,998.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There was,” writes Earl Stanhope, “strong reason, however, to
suspect many fraudulent practices in the previous days, since it seemed
clear that the total number of votes recorded was considerably beyond
the number of persons entitled to the franchise. For this reason Sir
Cecil Wray at once demanded a scrutiny, and the High Bailiff&mdash;illegally,
as Fox contended&mdash;granted the request. But further still, the High
Bailiff, Mr. Corbett, who was no friend to Fox, refused to make any
legal return until this scrutiny should be decided. Thus Westminster
was left for the present destitute of Representatives, and Fox would
have been without a seat in the new Parliament but for the friendship
of Sir Thomas Dundas, through which he had been already returned
the member for the close boroughs of Kirkwall.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Gallant Whig poetasters were rapturous in their praises
of the fair canvassers who were making such havoc in the
Tory ranks.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Tories in their annoyance resorted to libels of the
most ungallant and ungenerous order; they accused the
duchess of wholesale bribery, and reported that she had
in one instance bought the vote of a butcher with a kiss,
a rumour which was immediately seized by the whimsical
wits for the basis of endless exaggerations. “The Devonshire,
or Most Approved Method of Securing Votes”
embodies the butcher episode. The practice of claiming
some slight service, rewarded at election times with extravagant
liberality, as a subterfuge for bribery, is shown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
in the duchess engaging an elector to put a stitch in
her shoe, and illustrated as “The Wit’s Last Stake; or,
the Cobbling Voter and Abject Canvassers.”</p>

<p>Besides “The Devonshire, or Most Approved Method of
Securing Votes,” two caricatures appeared on the 12th of
April from Rowlandson’s prolific graver: one, exhibiting
the struggle between the fair canvassers arrayed in rivalry
at Covent Garden hustings, under the symbol of “The
Poll:” a balancing plank, whereon the beauteous Georgiana
“Devon’s Queen,” is elevated high in the air, while her
stouter rival, the Hon. Mrs. Hobart (Lady Buckinghamshire),
is overweighing her extremely. Above the heads
of the group, which includes the rival candidates, Fox,
Hood, and Wray, flutters a placard, “The Rival Candidates,
a Farce.” Against Wray was revived, in allusion
to the Court patronage under which he was fighting, the
well-worn cry of “Slavery and wooden shoes,” and much
stress was laid on the extreme measure of polling the
Guards as householders; in reference to the two hundred
and eighty votes given by soldiers at one time in a body&mdash;an
astounding manœuvre, which shocked constitutional
minds&mdash;appeared the placard:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“All Horse Guards, Grenadier Guards, Foot Guards, and Black-Guards,
that have not polled for the destruction of Chelsea Hospital
and the Tax on Maidservants are desired to meet at the <i>Gutter Hole</i>,
opposite the Horse Guards, where they will have a full bumper of
<i>knock-me-down</i> and plenty of <i>soap-suds</i>, before they go to the poll for
Sir Cecil Wray or eat. N.B.&mdash;Those who have no shoes or stockings
may come without, <i>there being a quantity of wooden shoes provided for
them</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A further presentment of the famous canvassing
duchess, whose prominence at the great Westminster election
of 1784 gave her such universal and lasting celebrity,
is offered by Rowlandson in a fanciful domestic interior
at Devonshire House, where the favoured candidate, Fox,
and his staunch and invaluable ally, “brave Sammy
House,” are introduced as “Lords of the Bedchamber”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
(April 14, 1784). In the caricaturist’s highly imaginary
version, the duchess is entertaining the pair with a cup
of tea in her boudoir; above her hangs the Reynolds
portrait of her liege-lord. Sam House, in his publican’s
jacket, otherwise attired in that neat costume which became
historical, is stirring the cup “that cheers but not inebriates”
with an air of supreme contentment, while Fox is
patting, in friendly familiarity, the no less remarkable
completely bald head of his indefatigable supporter by
way of encouragement.</p>

<p>The third plate, “The Westminster Watchman,” is
inscribed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To the Independent Electors of Westminster, this Print of their
staunch old watchman, the guardian of their rights and privileges, is
dedicated by a grateful Elector. N.B.&mdash;Beware of Counterfeits, as
the Greenwich and Chelsea Watchmen are upon the look-out!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Fox is standing firm, with his cap of “Liberty;” and the
lamp of “Truth” is shedding its light around, the Whig
chief is unmoved by the storm of “ministerial thunderbolts;”
a trusty dog, “Vigilance,” is by his side; the
“Counterfeits” are shuffling off, Hood for Greenwich, and
Wray for Chelsea.</p>

<p>The ballads, epigrams, and poetical <i>jeux d’esprit</i> to
which the circumstances of this famous contest gave birth
are sufficiently numerous to fill a volume. The rhymsters
on both sides were evidently resolved to do their best:
many of the lyrics and “squibs” are worthy of preservation;
they are as a rule far above the average compositions
evoked upon similar occasions. The tuneful songster, Captain
Morris, wrote many of the most graceful and witty
“impromptus” and verses. The bards of “Opposition”
were severe upon the Court influence exerted against Fox’s
cause, and justly exposed some of the manœuvres resorted
to by Pitt’s adherents.</p>

<p>The turn of affairs which placed Fox in a majority over
Sir Cecil Wray, who for some time was in advance of the
Whig chief, is summed up by Rowlandson, amongst other
caricaturists, as “The Case is altered” (April 29, 1784).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
The election had nearly another three weeks to run, but
already the satirists were forecasting the result. Fox, be
it remembered, had other resources in reserve, and, at the
close of the poll, when Wray demanded a scrutiny, and
the high bailiff illegally declined to make his return, he
was seated for Kirkwall. In the caricaturist’s version, the
election has already settled Wray’s chances, and Fox is
magnanimously driving off his defeated opponent, and late
dependent, to Lincoln: the ministerial candidate is travelling,
“without drums or trumpets,” smuggled away from
the exciting platform of the hustings, in the “Lincolnshire
caravan for paupers;” he is buried in self-contemplation,&mdash;“I
always was a poor dog, but now I am worse than ever.”
The generous Fox, charioteering his renegade <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, is
volunteering, “I will drive you to Lincoln, where you may
superintend the <i>small beer</i> and <i>brickdust</i>.” Lord Hood’s
majority was safe at the head of the poll,&mdash;for no reason
which history has made manifest; he is pictured as suddenly
surprising the degrading pauper-conveyance, and, in
compassion for his late colleague, is exclaiming, much
moved at these reverses, “Alas, poor Wray!”</p>

which a select group of outlying

triumph, and with “rough

<p>The fact that Wray&mdash;who, as a double “Renegado,”
shortly rejoined the Whigs&mdash;appears to have gained but
scant sympathy, was defeated and done for, is turned to
satirical account in a travestied view of Fox, North, and
the Duchess&mdash;the latter wearing a foxtail in her hat&mdash;“For
the Benefit of the Champion.&mdash;A Catch, to be performed at

SIR CECIL WRAY, WESTMINSTER ELECTION. 1784. BY T. ROWLANDSON.</p>

<p class="caption">“<i>Oh! help Judas, lest he fall into the Pitt of Ingratitude!!!</i></p>

<p>“The <i>prayers</i> of all bad Christians, Heathens, Infidels, and Devil’s Agents, are most
earnestly requested for their dear friend <span class="smcap">Judas Iscariot</span>, Knight of the <i>back-stairs</i>, lying
at the period of political dissolution, having received a dreadful wound from the exertions of
the lovers of liberty and the constitution, in the poll of the last ten days at the Hustings, nigh
unto the Place of Cabbages.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fate of Wray, with Fox reinstated in his seat for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Westminster, and the concluding election scenes at Covent
Garden are figured in “The Westminster Deserter Drumm’d
out of the Regiment.” Sam House, with his perfectly bald
head, and dressed in the clean and natty nankeen jacket
and trousers, his invariable wear summer and winter, is
drumming Wray off the stage: “May all Deserters feel
Public Resentment”&mdash;is the sentiment of both the indignant
Chelsea veterans and buxom maid-servants to whom
Wray’s projects had given mortal offence. “The Man of the
People” is planting the standard of Liberty and Britannia,
and acknowledging his gratitude to his supporters with
simple fervour&mdash;“Friends and fellow-citizens, I cannot
find words to express my feelings to you on the victory.”</p>

<p>Finally, as an apotheosis of the fair champion who had
contributed most of all to the success and glory of the
triumph over the Court, Rowlandson etched the allegorical
picture of “Liberty and Fame introducing Female Patriotism
to Britannia.”</p>

<p>At the close of the poll, Fox was 235 votes ahead of
Wray, but, as related, the high bailiff, Corbett, acting
partially, refused to return him on the plea that a scrutiny
had been demanded; Fox was also a candidate for Kirkwall,
so that, in case of defeat at Westminster he might
still have a seat.</p>

<p>At the end of the election there was an immense crowd
collected for the chairing of Fox. A classic car was prepared,
an improvement on the perilous glory of being
hoisted on the shoulders of excited chairmen, or, worse
still, lifted on those of volunteers&mdash;intoxicated alike with
enthusiasm and drinking toasts. The Whig chief mounted
his triumphal chariot; a multitudinous procession following,
closed by the state-carriages of the Duchesses of Portland
and Devonshire, drawn by six horses each. Fox
descended from the car at Devonshire House, where was
erected a temporary scaffolding, on which was raised a
bevy of notabilities, including the Prince of Wales, with the
Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, to whose exertions Fox
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
owed a debt of gratitude. A commemorative dinner was
given at Willis’s Rooms, where Fox made a glowing speech
on the subject of the election. The Prince of Wales, after
attending the king at a review at Ascot, rode up St. James’s
Street in his uniform, and was received with acclamations,
in acknowledgment of his partisanship for the Whig chief,
whose favours he wore,&mdash;and ended his day of triumph by
dining at Devonshire House, where he appeared wearing
Fox’s colours (the Washington uniform), and with a laurel
branch in token of victory.</p>

<p>The party rejoicings and festivities at the conclusion of
this election are felicitously related by Wraxall, who enjoyed
the advantages of himself participating in the scenes
he pictures. “Still the Whigs were not to be disappointed of
their ovation. The exultation of those gay times forms a
strange contrast to the grim monotony of our own. Fox,
after being chaired in great pomp through the streets, was
finally carried into the court-yard of Carlton House. The
Prince’s plume was on his banners in acknowledgment of
princely partisanship. A banner, inscribed ‘Sacred to
Female Patriotism,’ recorded the services of the Duchess.
The carriages of the Dukes of Devonshire and Portland,
each drawn by six horses, moved in procession, and Fox’s
own carriage was a pile of rejoicing Whiggism. On its
boxes and traces, and where they could, sat Colonel North,
afterwards Lord Guilford; Adam, who but a few years
before wounded the patriot in a duel; and a whole cluster
of political friends, followers, and expectants. The prince
came to the balustrade before the house<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> to cheer him,
with a crowd of fashionable people. Fox finished the
triumph by an harangue to the mob, and they in return
finished by a riot, an illumination, and breaking Lord
Temple’s windows.</p>

<p>“But the festivities were scarcely begun. The prince
threw open his showy apartments to the nobility, and gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
them a brilliant <i>f&ecirc;te</i> in the gardens, which happened to
be at its height just when the king was passing through
St. James’s Park in state to open the new parliament. The
rival interests were within a brick wall of each other, and
their spirit could not have been more strangely contrasted
than in their occupations. But nights and days to those
graceful pursuers of pleasure and politics alike knew no
intermission. On that very evening the celebrated beautiful
and witty Mrs. Crewe gave a brilliant rout, in which ‘blue
and buff’ were the universal costume of both sexes; the buff
and blue were the uniform of Washington and his troops,
and imprudently adopted by Fox to declare his hostility to
the Government. The prince himself appeared in the party
colours. At supper, he toasted the fair giver of the feast in
the words ‘True Blue and Mrs. Crewe.’ The lady, not
unskilfully, and with measureless applause, returned it by
another, ‘True Blue and all of you.’”</p>

<p>With the enforced termination of the polling at the
fortieth day, arrived the demand of Wray for a scrutiny,
and the high bailiff’s unjustifiable attitude, for which he
subsequently suffered severely, of declining to make a return,
compelled Fox to look elsewhere for a seat, or find no
place in the coming parliament, where, as Walpole said,
could Fox have stood for every seat in the kingdom he
would have represented the entire return in his own person,
such was his influence and popularity. “The Departure,”
(May 18, 1784), the day succeeding the close of the poll,
shows Fox leaving behind him the palatial abode of his
warm supporter, the Prince of Wales, and taking leave of
his delectable champions, the Duchess of Devonshire and
her sister, the fair Lady Duncannon, <i>en route</i> for “Coventry”
or “Out-in-the-cold-shire.” Fox is observing on his
retreat:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Fox’s early ally, Burke, equipped as an outrider, is
prepared to drive his friend away from the scene of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
triumphs; under Edmund’s arm is a “plan of economy,”
suggestive of necessary retrenchments in the Whig camp.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 287.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Among the tactics of the Ministerialists may be reckoned
the ominous “scrutiny,” which was threatened directly
Fox’s votes began to outnumber those in favour of his
rival, Wray. On Fox’s success this intention was carried
out, the returning officer acting partially in order to connive
at the manœuvre; a scrutiny being notoriously a tedious,
lengthy, and costly affair, and hence more vexations to
Fox than to the combined forces of his opponents. This
circumstance is illustrated by the caricaturist, nearly a
twelvemonth later; when the excitement of the protracted
contest had cooled down, Fox secured another victory over
his adversaries, which is commemorated in Rowlandson’s
version of the affair (March 7, 1785), entitled:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Defeat of the high and mighty Balissimo Corbettino and his famed
Cecilian forces, on the plains of St. Martin, on Thursday, the 3rd day
of February, 1785, by the Champion of the People and his chosen
band, after a smart skirmish, which lasted a considerable time, in
which many men were lost on both sides. But their great ally at
length losing ground, desertions took place, and notwithstanding their
vast superiority in numbers and weight of metal at the first onset, this
increased apace, altho’ often rallied by the ablest man in command,
till at length the forces gave way in all quarters, and they were totally
overthrown. This print is dedicated to the Electors of the City and
Liberty of Westminster, who have so nobly stood forth and supported
their champion upon this trying occasion, by <span class="smcap">an Independent
Elector</span>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Rowlandson has pictured the rival combatants at the
head of their learned forces. Fox’s lawyers are triumphant,
and armed with such legal weapons as “Eloquence,”
“Truth,” “Perseverance,” and “Law;” the Whig chief,
in person, is dealing vengeance upon the disconcerted figures
of his antagonists, Wray and Corbett. Fox had successfully
prosecuted his action and recovered heavy damages against
the bailiff, who, as a courtier, had made himself the tool
of the Ministerialists. Fox is defended by his buckler,
“Majority 38;” he is wielding the keen sword of “Justice;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
a laurel crown is placed on the chieftain’s brow by a celestial
messenger, who is charged with the decision of the Law
Court&mdash;“It is ordered that Thomas Corbett, Esq., do immediately
return.” Fox is declaring:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The wrath of my indignation is kindled, and I will pursue them
with a mighty hand and outstretched arm until justice is done to those
who have so nobly supported me.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Sir Cecil Wray’s defence of “Ingratitude” is a sorry shield
for the protection of himself or of his fallen ally; his sword
is broken; in despair he cries, “My knees wax feeble, and
I sink beneath the weight of my own apostasy.” The high
bailiff is cast down; he confesses, “My conscience is now
at peace.” Another supporter of the returning officer is
exclaiming, “Help, help! our chief is fallen. O conscience,
support me!” Corbett’s lawyers have turned their abashed
backs on their client and his cause: “Nor law, nor conscience,
nor the aid of potent Ministers, can e’er support the
contest ’gainst such a chief!”  “Our support is gone, and
we are fallen into a Pitt; yea, even into a deep Pitt!”&mdash;the
premier having been unable to protect the guilty against
the consequences of their act.

<span class="medium">REMARKABLE ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL MEETINGS,
1788 TO 1807.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">We have seen Admiral Lord Hood’s energetic canvass
at the great Westminster election, when, with the powerful
assistance of the Court, he fought the Whigs, but failed
to hinder Fox’s election. In spite of the victory gained
in 1784 by their opponents, four years later the ministerialists
and the “king’s friends” were again forced into
a fresh contest on the same field, and more ignominiously
defeated; the popular Lord Hood, their chosen champion,
having in July, 1788, been appointed to a seat at the
Admiralty Board, as a recognition of his services to
Government, a fresh election was necessary for the city
of Westminster. The Whigs were still to the front, and
Lord John Townshend came forward and canvassed in
that interest, with such strong support from the Opposition
that the ministers now experienced a more inglorious
reverse, their candidate being unseated, although recourse
was had to every expedient, lawful or otherwise, that could
promote the return of Hood, the Government nominee.
After the close of the poll, which showed Lord John
Townshend with 6392 votes, to Lord Hood’s 5569, thus
giving two Whig members for Westminster, Gillray exposed
the corrupt practices of the Court agents in the caricature,
published on August 14, 1788, entitled, “Election Troops
Bringing in their Accounts to the Pay-Table.” The
premier is seen behind the bars of the Treasury gates; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
undisguised and direct applications of his quondam allies
are so compromising that it is inexpedient to admit the
claimants, or acknowledge an acquaintance with such
disreputable connections; but a saving compromise is
suggested. Pitt is made to plausibly protest, “I know
nothing of you, my friends. Lord Hood pays all the
expenses himself;” then, in a whisper, “Hush! go to
the back-door in Great George Street, under the Rose.”
Sir George Rose was Pitt’s secretary and <i>factotum</i>; he
is chiefly seen in the contemporary satires as associated
with what was called “back-stairs influence,” of which
he may be accepted as chamberlain; his scene of operations
was generally represented as the “back-door of the
Treasury,” where he diplomatically carried out the stratagems
of the premier&mdash;especially, as in the present instance&mdash;in
the indirect recognition of secret services.</p>

<p class="caption">BY JAMES GILLRAY.</p>
</div>

<p>Foremost in the rank of election troops is the modish
Major Topham, a conspicuous personage in his day, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
frequently appears in the caricatures of the time; his
notoriety was due to the <i>World</i>, a society newspaper of
the last century, of which the major was proprietor, editor,
and fashionable gossip-monger. Topham has brought a
copy of his organ to prove the active support he had lent
the Government during the Westminster contest, and is the
first to present his bill “for puffs and squibs, and for
abusing the Opposition.”</p>

<div id="i_291" class="figcenter w25">

<p class="caption">AN INDEPENDENT
ELECTOR.</p>
</div>

<p>A ragged newsboy from the <i>Star</i> has also brought his
journal and a claim for payment “for changing sides, for
hiring ballad-singers, and Grub Street writers.” As usual,
some scenes of a desperate character had marked the
election, and three downright bullies, giant troopers of the
Guards, with ensanguined bayonets as evidence of their
late employment, demand pay “for the attack in Bow
Street;” a publican brings in a reckoning
“for eating and drinking for jackass
boys;” ballad-singers have come to
claim “five shillings a day” for their
professional services; a cobbler, with
Hood’s cockade, presents a modest bill
“for voting three times” as “an independent
elector;” a clothesman of the
Hebrew persuasion is clamouring for
money “for perjury, and procuring Jew
voters;” and a body of Hood’s sailors,
armed with formidable cudgels, are come
for payment “for kicking up a row,”&mdash;as
in the election of 1784, Hood’s
boisterous sailors were brought up to
the hustings to support their admiral, and were particularly
violent and reckless in their zeal for the cause,
intimidating those voters who were recognized as favouring
the opposite party, and forcibly keeping them away from
the polling booth. These jolly Jack Tars, with perfect
singleness of mind, and oblivious of nice distinctions which
they did not understand, were filled to overflowing with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
explosive loyalty for the king, and fealty for their admiral;
but on this occasion the sailors were beaten by the Irish
chairmen with hearty goodwill, and, with their patron, Lord
Hood, experienced a defeat.</p>

<p>In 1790, it is consolatory to find that the gallant Lord
Hood was again returned for Westminster; Fox heading
the poll with 3516 votes; Hood, as a good second, with
3217: on this occasion the Whigs lost a seat, for John
Horne Tooke, although so prominent a figure, failed to
repeat the success of Lord John Townshend, 1679 votes
were polled for the “Parson of Brentford,” otherwise John
Horne Tooke, the celebrated philologist.</p>

<p>Curious anomalies were witnessed under the old boroughmongering
system, anterior to the sweeping measure of
reform. Helston, in Cornwall, was a typical case. The
elective franchise was formerly invested in the corporation,
which consisted of the mayor, who was the returning
officer, eleven aldermen, and twenty-five common council-men,
thirty-six in all. The old charter of Elizabeth was
confirmed by Charles I., and, according to common report,
there survived but one elector under this charter in 1790,
to whose lot accordingly fell the unusual distinction of
nominating two representatives on his own account.</p>

<p>The family interest of the Osbornes (Duke of Leeds)
proved so paramount as to here prevent any hope of
successfully contesting against their power.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that a certain grace was lent
to the generally discordant elements of electioneering by
the zealous participation of Beauty in the canvassing
department, where the seductive wiles of female charms
and persuasions were relied upon, it is understood, with

<p class="caption">PROOF OF THE REFINED FEELINGS OF AN AMIABLE CHARACTER, LATELY A CANDIDATE FOR A CERTAIN ANCIENT CITY. BY JAMES GILLRAY.</p>

<p>The assistance of the fair sex was much relied upon for
soliciting and securing votes; but at such turbulent times,
when licence predominated, the electioneering Circes must
have been prepared for brusque exchanges of pleasantry,
though hardly for such encounters as the one preserved
in Gillray’s “Proof of the Refined Feelings of an Amiable
Character, lately a Candidate for a Certain Ancient City.”</p>

<p>Some obscurity surrounds the incident represented;
obviously the caricature was destined for electioneering
purposes, but the positive history cannot he traced. It
is assumed that the three circumstances of the candidate
being “an eccentric,” a sportsman, and a representative
of a cathedral city point to Sir Charles Turner (created
a baronet by the Marquis of Rockingham in 1782), who
represented York from 1768 to 1783. This gentleman
always dressed as a sportsman, wearing a green coat,
“tally-ho” buttons, with top-boots, etc., upon all occasions;
he was described by Coombe (<i>Royal Register</i>) as the
“Marplot” of his own party, “and in his parliamentary
capacity demands the pity of his friends, the contempt
of the wise, and makes himself a laughing stock for the
crowd.” On the discussion of Pitt’s motion for parliamentary
reform, May 7, 1782, Sir Charles Turner by his
blunt originality attracted more attention than either the
mover or seconder; he declared&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“that in his opinion the House of Commons might be justly considered
as a parcel of thieves, who, having stolen an estate, were
apprehensive of allowing any person to see their title deeds, from the
fear of again losing it by such an inspection.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The personage depicted by Gillray is flourishing his whip
“Pro bono Patri&aelig;,” and forcibly demonstrating his aversion
to rival canvassers of the gentle sex, much to the
consternation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and gownsmen,
while the rough townsmen are cheering their eccentric
candidate, and promising to support him.</p>

<p>It is to Gillray that we owe the version embodying the
glorification of autocratic boroughmongering as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>“The

Pacific Entrance of Earl Wolf into Blackhaven,” January,
1792. Before Lord Grey’s Reform Bill altered the constituencies,
in the sordid old days of corrupt influence,
when the representative system of electing parliaments
was purely theoretical, a certain number of territorial
magnates apportioned about half the constituencies between
them; of this, the “upper order,” or aristocratic patrons,
trafficked in the seats in exchange for “honours” for
themselves, or lent their boroughs to support ministerial
influence in return for places and pensions, or offices&mdash;sinecures
for choice&mdash;in which to provide for their less
opulent relations; thus in the old lists of place-holders,
pensioners, and “ministerial patronage” may be traced
the younger sons and cousins in several degrees, besides
the names of those who have by marriage entered the
families of the prime holders of “marketable ware,” otherwise
parliamentary interest. When boroughmongering
was a profession&mdash;a very highly paid one&mdash;and boroughs
were farmed for sale, it might be expected that a less
elevated class of adventurers would treat the question of
buying and selling “seats” in parliament like any ordinary
item of commerce, as was the fact; the markets
fluctuated, thus we find Lord Chesterfield, whose authority
is unquestionable, looking round for some venal borough
to bring in that young hopeful to whom he addressed the
famous “Letters,” thinking it a finishing part of a gentleman’s
training to be in the House; the ex-ambassador
communicated with an agent, proposing to pay “twenty-four
hundred pounds for a seat,” presumably the price in
Chesterfield’s younger days; but he found seats had risen
to inordinate rates&mdash;up to five thousand pounds&mdash;owing
to imported competition, chiefly rich factors returned home
with fortunes from the East and West Indies. Bubb
Dodington has set down in his “Diary” how he, the lordly
proprietor of this said “marketable ware,” went about
bargaining to bring in ministerial nominees for his five or
six seats in exchange for places at the disposal of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
administration; and instances might be multiplied to a
tedious extent from the journals of the House containing the
evidence of trafficking in boroughs and buying up voters,
<i>en gros et en d&eacute;tail</i>, as disclosed on controverted elections.</p>

<p>This condition of affairs produced a mechanical majority
as long as the prime minister in power could command
wealth and influence sufficient to secure a larger number
of seats than the opposition. It was in this direction that
the famous electioneering genius, the Marquis of Wharton,
spent a hundred thousand pounds in William III. and
Queen Anne’s days; while Walpole manipulated such huge
sums, thinly disguised as “Secret Service Money,” that,
never wealthy enough to purchase all, and meeting occasional
honest members, he was, at intervals, impeached
for corruption in a House two-thirds venal, as it is alleged.</p>

<p>Walpole’s successors, who finally drove him from office,
bought elections on even a more extended scale; the
Pelhams were clever dissemblers and apt negotiators for
this commodity; it was written of the Duke of Newcastle,
by his antagonist, Lord Hervey, it is believed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And since his estate at Elections he’ll spend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beggar himself without making a friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So while the extravagant fool has a sous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his brains I can’t fear, so his fortune I’ll use.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Major Cartwright, the advocate of universal suffrage,
who had the misfortune to live a trifle before the times
were ripe enough for reform to be carried, addressed a
petition to parliament in 1820, showing “that 97 Lords
usurped 200 seats in the Commons House in violation of
our Laws and Liberties;” while 90 wealthy commoners
“for 102 vile sinks of corruption (pocket boroughs) brought
in the House 137 members;” Ministerial patronage returning
another twenty, thus giving, according to the
petitioner’s statistics, “a total of 353 members corruptly
or tyrannically imposed on the Commons in gross violation
of the law, and to the palpable subversion of the constitution.”
At that time the Earl of Lonsdale commanded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
eight seats, as did the Earl of Darlington. William Pitt,
as already described, was seated in Parliament, 1781, by
Lonsdale, then Sir James Lowther, who had been stigmatized
by “Junius” as “The contemptuous tyrant of the
North,” and who himself declared that he was in possession
of the land, the fire, and the water of Whitehaven. When
the youthful Pitt became premier, one of his first acts was
to acknowledge his obligations to “the Wolf,” and Lowther
was raised to the peerage as Earl Lonsdale. The “pacific
entrance” of this plutocrat shows the docile “free and
independent voters” of Whitehaven, driven by Lonsdale’s
law agent, and lashed with thongs of “sham suits at law,”
dragging the earl through the tumble-down streets of his
town, every window being illuminated with candles in his
honour. He exclaims, “Dear gentlemen, this is too much;
now you really distress me!” Mobs of his miners are
cheering vociferously, he having brought the townsmen to
submission by suspending the working of his coal-mines.
Fair canvassers, with complimentary inscriptions on their
banners, head the triumphal procession:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Before the parliamentary dissolution of 1796, the country
was in an agitated state, for distress was prevalent among
the poorer classes, the expenses of the continental wars
were impoverishing the country, and there was a general
outcry for peace; bread riots were common at the time,
and the price of provisions in general was exceptionally
high; political agitators were taking advantage of these
circumstances to fulminate against the king and his
ministers; while the various societies, called “seditious”
by the Tories in office, received encouragement from the
Whig party, whose prospects of succeeding to power were
not encouraging. A meeting of an enthusiastic nature,
largely attended, had been held in St. George’s Fields, the
scene of the former riots, to petition for annual parliaments,
and for universal suffrage, theories which at that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
time were regarded hopefully, and which would, it was
anticipated, redress existing grievances. In the autumn
of 1795, meetings were held at Copenhagen Fields, where
an immense multitude assembled to sign addresses and
remonstrances on the state of the nation. The immediate
consequences of the inflammatory orations pronounced to
the people on this occasion was that, on the opening of the
final session of the parliament which had assembled in
1790, the king, on his way to the Peers to open the House
in state, was assailed by vociferous cries of “Give us peace
and bread!” “No war!” “No king!” “Down with him!
down with George!” Before the House of Peers was
reached, an attack was made on the royal carriage, stones
were thrown, and one passed through the window. The
riot on this occasion was made the pretext for the ministry
to bring forward new bills for the defence of the king’s
person, and to attempt further infringements on the liberty
of the subject by interfering with the right of public
meetings.</p>

<p>The political clubs renewed their clamours for a more
extended system of representation freed from corruption,
and protested against Pitt’s new enactments; the London
Corresponding Society called another public meeting, at
which the premier is said to have shown symptoms of
alarm. Gillray’s engraving of a meeting of “Patriotic
Citizens at Copenhagen House,” November 16, 1795,
satirizes the order of agitators and their disciples as the
dregs of the people, which he represents them to be. This
demonstration, which was largely attended, was held to
protest against the “Seditions Bill” for the protection of
the king’s person, for which, it was argued, ample provisions
were already legalized. Petitions to both Houses
were prepared, and remonstrances numerously signed.</p>

<p>This situation is embodied in the picture of the assembly.
The orator, Thelwall, is holding forth to an audience which
is more picturesque than distinguished. Platforms are
arranged at intervals as rostrums for the speakers, at one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
of which a butcher is enlarging on “The Rights of Citizens.”
The proprietress of a halfpenny gaming-table has labelled
it, “Equality and no Sedition Bill.” An emissary of
Thelwall’s is offering the remonstrance to sweep-boys for
signature; and the autographs attached thereto, though
notorious, are hardly such as to command the respect of
parliament&mdash;“Jack Cade, Wat Tyler, Jack Straw, etc.”</p>

<p>After the elections of 1784 parliament was entirely in
the control of Pitt. It met, wrote Horace Walpole, “as
quietly as a Quarter Session,” the opposition seemed
quelled, or driven to despair.</p>

<p>The meeting at Copenhagen House failed to accomplish
its purpose, and further protests were entered against the
Seditions Bill “for the better protection of the king’s
person,” which was carried in the House by large majorities;
this repressive measure provided that no gathering
exceeding fifty persons should take place, even in a private
house, without previous information had been laid before
a magistrate, who might attend, and, if he saw cause,
order the meeting to disperse, while those who resisted
would be guilty of felony. In the face of such unconstitutional
interference, fresh hostility sprang up throughout
the land; and there being anticipations of an appeal to
the country, the opposition endeavoured to present a bold
front before the constituencies in view of that event; one
of these meetings was summoned by the Sheriff of Middlesex,
inviting the freeholders to assemble at the Mermaid,
Hackney; this gathering has been commemorated by
Gillray. The object of the meeting was to obtain a repeal
of the obnoxious Seditions Bill, which, as the artist shows,
the Whig member, George Byng, is vigorously denouncing
from the platform; it was at the same time proposed to
prepare an “Address to the King,” and Mr. Mainwaring,
the ministerial representative, is, with Jesuitical expression,
deprecating hostility both to the Government and to
their oppressive legislation, Fox is holding the hat of his
oratorical disciple, Byng. It was on this occasion that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
sturdy Duke of Norfolk, who raised the royal ire by proposing
as a toast in a public assembly, “The Majesty of
the People,” took occasion to warn those who valued the
liberty of the subject that they must not be misled by
the specious titles of the bill.</p>

<p>Mainwaring stated in the House that the meeting had

<p>As we have seen, in describing the elections of 1784,
the results of which ended for a while all the prospects
of the Whigs, William Pitt was called to office in the
face of an unmanageable opposition, and almost in contravention
of the voice of parliament; the youthful
premier’s bold resort to dissolution, with his energetic
election tactics, disembarrassed him of the troublesome
majority, and placed at his disposal a perfectly docile
House. The progress of our relations with France, and
many unpopular and stringent measures, like the Seditions
Bill, had revived antagonism, and every fresh legislation
which encroached on the rights of the people weakened
the Government influence. Pitt, anticipating the struggle,
boldly resorted to his old policy, and the intention of
dissolving parliament was announced in the speech from
the throne. Gillray, whose admirable caricatures illustrate
the leading political events from 1782 to 1810, has
epitomized the situation as “The Dissolution, or the Alchymist
Procuring an &AElig;therial Representation,” May 21,
1796. Pitt is seated on the model of his new barracks;
the transmutation is carried out from the premier’s recipe,
“Antidotus Republica;” Treasury coals, <i>i.e.</i> golden pieces,
feed the furnace; the breeze is raised by the Crown as
a bellows; the old House of Commons, seen in the alembic,
shows a few tenants, such as Fox and Sheridan, left on
the opposition benches, but all is rapidly dissolving into
a new chamber, where the alchemist is enthroned as “Perpetual
Dictator,” “Magna Charta” and “Parliamentary
Rights” become his foot-stools, and adulation of the most
slavish order is offered up by the members of the newly
constituted and subservient Commons.</p>

<p>Maidstone, for which Benjamin D’Israeli took his seat
in 1837, has been the scene of many severe and exceptionally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
costly contests. At the general election, 1796, the
defeated candidate, Christopher Hull, is reported to have
polled the greatest number of single votes ever tendered
for that constituency, he having expended three thousand
pounds in about seven hours. This heavy outlay proved
fruitless, as Mr. Hull stood last on the list; but attempting
to make a merit of this liberal use of money, the reputation
of which he hoped might serve for a future occasion,
the incipient “electioneerer” was assured by his friends
“he must start on fresh grounds, as the present would be
considered as nothing more than electioneering experience.”</p>

<p>The general election of 1796 was less fruitful in
incidents than its predecessor in 1790. The celebrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
philologist, John Horne Tooke, endeavoured to gain the
second seat, as the colleague of the great Whig chief. On
this occasion “the Brentford parson” secured, though
unsuccessful, a larger number of votes; Fox was returned
at the head of the poll, and Sir A. Gardner was second.
Gillray has left a characteristic likeness of the Whig chief,
very “spick and span,” deferentially bowing from “The
Hustings,” in acknowledgment of the ribald, if popular,
reception his admirers are according their old “true blue”
member for Westminster. Fox is pressing to his heart, in
parody of another measure, the “Pewter Pot Bill.” “Ever
guardian of your most sacred rights, I have opposed the
Pewter Pot Bill.” His audience is filled with enthusiasm.
As an allusion to Fox’s supposed sympathies with events
then proceeding in France&mdash;the pot-boy of “The Tree of

<p>It was in the session of 1797 that Mr. Grey first
moved “for leave to bring in a bill to reform the representation
of the country.” The motion, seconded by Erskine,
was debated until three o’clock in the morning&mdash;an exceptional
sitting in those days&mdash;when it was rejected by a
Government majority of fifty-eight votes. Although the
system of representation was notoriously corrupt, at least
half the seats being in the patronage of interested persons,
it was thirty-four years before Earl Grey’s measure for
reform could be carried, and then only under extraordinary
circumstances. After Grey’s earlier defeat, it was felt that
in a House of Commons completely submissive to the
ministerial dictates, and which resisted amendment, the
opposition leaders could make no impression, and they
accordingly announced their intention for the present of
taking no further part in its proceedings; the voice of Fox
was scarcely heard in the House till the century closed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after the secession of the Whig party from
the debates, the agitation throughout the country increased,
political societies became more active, and frequent meetings
were held to discuss the necessity for parliamentary
reform. One of the most remarkable of these was held
under the auspices of Bertie Greathead, the owner of
“Guy’s Cliff,” near Warwick; a medal commemorative
of this gathering and its object, reform, was struck for the
occasion. These medals were a popular method of spreading
political opinions. The patriotic reform medal was parodied
by another of a loyal nature, representing the devil suspending
three halters over the heads of the demagogues,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
who are mounted in “a condemned cart;” on the one side
are shown the applauding “wrong-heads,” while a large
assembly of “right-heads” express
their contempt for the proceedings.</p>

<p>A parody of the patriotic medal
struck in commemoration of the
Reform meeting held at Greathead’s,
Guy’s Cliff, Warwick.</p>
</div>

<p>The Tories exulted over the
secession of “the party,” and
numerous caricatures appeared,
imputing all sorts of offences to
the Whigs; and one version
represented Fox as “Phaeton”
involving the Whig Club in his
destruction. We have noticed
the candidature of Horne Tooke
for Westminster; ever since his prominence upon the
occasion of Wilkes’s return for Middlesex in 1768, the
“Brentford Parson” had striven to obtain a seat in
parliament. He was in 1798 one of the most conspicuous
members of the reform associations. Few were his match
in ready eloquence, his pen was ever active, and his
writings to the purpose. At an earlier stage of his career, a
pamphlet appeared, written, it was alleged, by his hand,
contrasting the two Pitts with the two Foxes as a pair of
portraits; the comparison being in favour of the former.
Advantage was taken of this circumstance to bring into
discredit the confederation of Horne Tooke (who held more
democratic views) with Fox for the advancement of the
reform cause. James Gillray designed for the <i>Anti-Jacobin
Review</i> his own satirical version of “Two Pair of Portraits,
presented to all the unbiased Electors of Great Britain,
by John Horne Tooke,” December 1, 1798. The eminent
philologer is represented as a portrait-painter, seated before
his easel, on which appear the two original likenesses of
the Whig and Tory chiefs, Pitt resting on the pedestal
of “Truth,” and Fox on that of “Deceit.” The presentment
of Lord Holland with the plunder of “unaccounted
millions” so frequently quoted, is placed beside the portrait
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
of the patriotic Earl of Chatham, dowered with the
“Rewards of a Grateful Nation.” Horne Tooke, who has
in his pocket, “Sketches of Patriotic Views, a pension,
a mouth-stopper, a place,” is presumed to be retouching
his unflattering and sinister portrait of the Whig chief,
while demanding of the electors of Great Britain, which
two of them will you choose to hang in your Cabinets, the
<span class="smcap">Pitts</span> or the <span class="smcap">Foxes</span>? “Where, on your conscience, should
the other two be hanged?” Allusions to various periods
of the limner’s life and principles appear round the studio&mdash;the
windmill at Wimbledon (where Tooke resided), the
parsonage at Brentford, the bust of Machiavel, the shadow
or “silhouette” of the Abb&eacute; Si&eacute;y&egrave;s; the picture of his
old friend Wilkes, in his aldermanic gown as the prosperous
and handsomely remunerated city chamberlain, <i>ci-devant</i>
Wilkes and Liberty; “The effect in this picture to be
copied as exact as possible;” “A London Corresponding
Society, <i>i.e.</i> a Sketch for an English Directory;” with
a folio of “Studies from French masters, Robespierre,
Tallien, Marat,” together with the prospectus for a new
work, “The Art of Political Painting, extracted from the
works of the most celebrated Jacobin professors.”</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Tavern, celebrated as the head-quarters
of the Whig party during Fox’s candidature for Westminster,
was the scene of a popular ovation on the twentieth
anniversary of the Whig chief’s election for that important
constituency; the event was celebrated by a public dinner,
October 10, 1800. Fox had so long absented himself
from Parliament, feeling, as he declared, “his time of
action was over when those principles were extinguished
on which he acted,” that his reappearance excited the
greatest enthusiasm amongst his partisans, who were
anxious both to hear his sentiments on the political outlook,
and to demonstrate their unabated attachment to the
“Man of the People,” who preferred to seclude himself
from public business and from the platform of his most
brilliant oratorical triumphs, that he “might steadily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
adhere to those principles which had guided his past conduct.”
Every room in the house was filled with company.
In replying to the cordial reception of his health, Fox
reminded his auditors that “During the twenty years I
have represented you in Parliament I have adhered to the
principles on which the Revolution of 1688 was founded,
and what have been known as the old Whig principles of
England;” and recalled that his first connection with his
constituents occurred “during the calamitous war with
America;” he then alluded to his absence from Parliament,
extended to three years, and thus eloquently concluded:
“I shall ever maintain that the basis of all
parties is justice&mdash;that the basis of all constitutions is the
sovereignty of the people&mdash;that from the people alone
kings, parliaments, judges, and magistrates derive their
authority.” Gillray has embodied this situation in his
pictorial version of this most enthusiastic reception, ungenerously
representing Fox as “The Worn-out Patriot;
or, the Last Dying Speech of the Westminster Representative,”
October 10, 1800. The great statesman is depicted
as both mentally and physically in a state of decadence;
Erskine is sustaining him with a bottle of brandy to
stimulate his strength artificially, while Harvey Combe,
in his robes as Lord Mayor, is lending his substantial support;
a measure of Whitbread’s “entire” is also ready for
the emergency. Among the guests are figured Sir J. Sinclair,
and the gifted member for Southwark, Tierney.
The speech the satirist has sarcastically introduced is a
parody on that delivered by the Whig chief to the electors
on the occasion:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Gentlemen, you see I am grown quite an old man in your service.
Twenty years I’ve served you, and always upon the same principles.
I rejoiced at the success of our enemies in the American War,
and the war against the virtuous French has always met with my most
determined opposition; but the infamous Ministry will not make peace
with our enemies, and are determined to keep me out of their councils
and out of place. Therefore, gentlemen, as their principles are quite
different from mine, and as I am now too old to form myself according

to their systems, my attendance in Parliament is useless, and, to say
the truth, I feel that my season of action is past, and I must leave to
younger men to act, for, alas! my failings and weaknesses will not let
me now recognize what is for the best.”</p></blockquote>

REPRESENTATIVE, ON THE ANNIVERSARY MEETING, HELD AT THE SHAKESPEARE
TAVERN, OCTOBER 10, 1800. BY JAMES GILLRAY.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pointed and pungent as is this version, it is on record that
Fox’s mental activity was still most brilliant; indeed, to
the extent of converting his consistent enemy, George III.
The supposed “Worn-out Patriot” lived to form an
administration in 1806 in conjunction with Lord Grenville,
who made Fox’s accession to power a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>. He
filled the office of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at
perhaps the most delicate and critical period of our history,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
when Napoleon entertained designs against England; and
on the death of the patriotic statesman, the king declared
“he had never known the duties of that office so efficiently
discharged for the honour of the country.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Who,” remarked a contemporary, “in reviewing Fox’s noble
adherence to the cause of Liberty, as it affected the American nation,
and weighing the wisdom of his forewarnings of the fatal consequences
of the American War, but must admire the prophetic spirit with which
he foretold all the direful events which resulted both to the Mother
Country and her colonies from that unnatural fratricidal war.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The first Parliament after the Union with Ireland met
January 22, 1801, and was marked by the reappearance
of Fox and the election of Horne Tooke for the borough
of Old Sarum through the influence of Lord Camelford.
The return of one who had been in holy orders involved a
great constitutional question; his admission was opposed
on the ground of his clerical profession, and it led to a bill
making clergymen incapable of sitting in parliament.
Tooke occupied his seat until the next dissolution, which
occurred the year following, when he was no longer eligible.
The circumstances are commemorated in a caricature by
Gillray, entitled, “Political Amusements for Young Gentlemen,
or the Brentford Shuttlecock between Old Sarum and
the Temple of St. Stephen’s,” March, 1801. Lord Temple
led the opposition to Tooke’s admission, and he is represented
as resisting his entrance to the House, within which
Fox is pictured crying, “The Church for Ever!” Lord
Camelford, who was in the navy, is batting the shuttlecock
from Old Sarum (the electors depicted as swine at a trough)
to the Commons; he cries, “There’s a stroke for you, messmate;
and if you kick him back, I’ll return him again, if
I should be sent on a cruise to Moorfields for it! Go it,
Coz.” Lord Temple is replying, “Send him back? Yes,
I’ll send him back twenty thousand times, before such a
high-flying Jacobin shuttlecock shall perch it here in his
Clerical band.” Lord Camelford’s “List of Candidates”
includes, besides Tooke, the names of Black Dick (his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
negro servant), and orator Thelwall, in case his ex-clerical
nominee’s election was annulled; but his lordship disclaimed
ever having entertained the intention of offering so gross
an insult to the House. The inscriptions on the feathers
stuck in the head of the noble lord’s plaything, “The Old
Brentford Shuttlecock,” are intended
to indicate his character.</p>

<p>Though the cause of Sir Francis
Delaval suffered at Andover from a
<i>contretemps</i> in which the commanding
officer of the district was concerned,
by an opposite course of events the
return of Mr. N. Jefferys for Coventry
was assured through military intervention.
When writs were issued for a
new parliament in 1802, a meeting was
convened at Coventry, when it was resolved to invite Mr.
Jefferys again to become a candidate to represent them,
and to support his re-election. Upon Mr. Jefferys accepting
this invitation, and proceeding down to Coventry to
meet his constituents, his entrance into the city was unhandsomely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
opposed, a riot ensued, and things began to
look dangerous, when Captain Barlow of the First Dragoon
Guards, who happened to be there, his regiment being
stationed in the neighbourhood, exerted himself with much
spirit to quell the riot and protect the candidate and his
friends from insult. Rarely has a casual and unexpected
service been more singularly acknowledged; Captain Barlow
was at once invited to join Mr. Jefferys as second Conservative
candidate, which he readily accepted; the show
of hands at the hustings was in his favour, and both were
triumphantly returned. The contest was a close one; Captain
Barlow stood at the head of the poll with 1197 votes,
N. Jefferys was elected with 1190; and the two Whig
candidates were defeated&mdash;Wilberforce Bird with 1182, and
Peter Moore with 1152 votes.</p>

<p>The Middlesex election of 1804 vividly recalled the previous
excitement manifested at the Brentford hustings on
the return of John Wilkes; the new party of “root-and-branch
reformers,” more extreme in their political views
than the Foxites, were now becoming most conspicuous by
their agitations for the revision of the Constitution, and
began to be known under the designation of Radicals. At
the head of these “patriots” in the House of Commons
were several of the younger politicians and “new luminaries,”
such as Whitbread, Lord Folkestone, and others;
but the most prominent leader of the movement was Sir
Francis Burdett, then occupying the position previously
held by “Wilkes and Liberty” at the commencement of the
reign, and by Fox before his secession from Parliament.
Horne Tooke, who passed out-of-doors as the baronet’s
political sponsor, “guide, philosopher, and friend,” was
actively supporting his pupil, and William Cobbett was, by
his energetic writings, proselytizing in the same cause, and
was generally regarded as the apostle of the latest sect. In
the same ranks were included the wealthy Bosville and
other zealous partisans. At the Middlesex election of 1802,
Sir Francis Burdett, in the Radical interest, had unseated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
the Tory candidate, W. Mainwaring, polling nearly double
the votes obtained by the ministerial candidate, who had
represented the county from 1784.</p>

<p>In 1804, the election for Middlesex was equally trying for
the administration as the memorable struggle at Westminster
in 1784, and recalled the scenes witnessed on the same
spot in 1786. Gillray has commemorated this occurrence
in one of his most elaborate caricatures, published August
7, 1804:&mdash;“Middlesex Election, 1804&mdash;a Long Pull, a
Strong Pull, and a Pull All Together;” the hustings at
Brentford appear in the distance, whereon the ministerial
candidate is holding forth to an exuberant crowd, amidst
which derisive symbols are displayed&mdash;a huge begging-box,
a gallows with an effigy suspended, and a banner inscribed,
“No Begging Candidate.” The head-quarters of the Court
party, at the sign of the Constitution (a crown and
mitre) placarded with posters, “Mainwaring, King, and
Country,” and advertising “good entertainment,” is treated
to a perfect shower of missiles and dirt; a free fight is proceeding
at a distance. Beneath the standard claiming
“Independence and Free Elections,” now a reasonable
aspiration, but, in those days, regarded as little short of
sedition, a rat is hung to a lantern, expressive of contempt
for “ministerial rats.” Sir Francis Burdett is carried
triumphantly to the hustings; his barouche, drawn by the
most illustrious members of the opposition, is emblazoned
on the panels with suggestive devices: “Peace” is figured
as a French eagle, with the legend, “<i>&Eacute;galit&eacute;</i>;” the Torch of
Liberty is a flaming and incendiary brand; and “Plenty”
is symbolized by a pot of porter with the head of Bonaparte
on the measure. Beneath the wheels of Burdett’s
chariot is figured a dog with “A Cur-tis” on his collar, a
blow at Sir William Curtis, enriched by “fat” Government
contracts; by him is Tooke’s tract, “A Squeeze for Contractors.”
On the box is the baronet’s reputed preceptor,
the Brentford Parson himself, “in his habit as he lived,”
smoking his pipe like his confederate “Bellenden,” that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
“revolution sinner” Dr. Parr; from the prime agitator’s
pockets fall the speeches, “hints,” and addresses it is
implied he had prepared for his hopeful pupil.</p>

</div>

<p>“The Party” is doing its utmost to forward Burdett’s
career, and to mortify the Ministry. Tyrwhitt Jones and
General Fitzpatrick, eccentric and independent politicians,
are leading the “marrow-bone and cleaver” music; two
lines of influential Whig statesmen are propelling the car;
Bosville, Grey, the Duke of Northumberland, the Marquis
of Lansdowne, and the Duke of Norfolk in one file, and
Lord Carlisle, the Duke of Bedford, Lord Derby, and Fox
in the other, all travestied felicitously under disguises which
the caricaturist has suggested as appropriate to their
characters or situations. Lord Moira (Marquis of Hastings),
with the prince’s plume on his instrument, is acting
as drummer. Behind the carriage rides Erskine in his bar
robes, with the cap of liberty on a pike, marked “The
Good Old Cause.” Tierney has “The Key of the Bastille,”
in allusion to Burdett’s
exertions on behalf of the
political prisoners with
which the prisons, such
as Coldbath Fields, were
at that time filled; while
Sheridan is raising aloft
the pictorial version of
the “Governor in All His
Glory,” <i>i.e.</i> Pitt flogging
Britannia, who is fixed in
the pillory, of which an
enlarged version appears.</p>

<p>The election contests in 1806 and 1807, which ensued
on the death of Fox, fully occupied the pencil of Gillray:
his elaborate cartoons, of which reduced <i>fac-similes</i> are
given, prove that election squibs must in his day have
enjoyed a large circulation; the artist seems to have developed
them into elaborate conceptions. Westminster was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
again the constituency, where the struggle was regarded as
of most absorbing interest. Sheridan, who had sat for
Stafford from 1780, now flattered himself that his popularity
and his intimacy with Fox would, on the decease of the
Whig chief, point him out as the natural successor of the
illustrious statesman. He found an embarrassing opponent
in James Paull (the son of a prosperous tailor), who had
returned from India, where he filled an appointment, and
brought home with him a moderate fortune and liberal
ideas as regarded administrative reform. His candidature
for Westminster was supported by the influence of all the
advanced politicians, the ultra-Liberals, and the Radical
Reformers.</p>

<p>In the first of Gillray’s satires on this topic, the “Triumphal
Procession of Little Paull, the Tailor, upon his
new Goose,” November 8, 1806, Sir Francis Burdett, who
was for some time travestied as “The Famous Green Goose,”
is lending Little Paull a helping mount; Tooke is leading
his pupil; Colonel Bosville is distributing money to make
the candidate popular; Cobbett, with “Political Register”
in hand, is canvassing for Paull and “Independence and
Public Justice”&mdash;referring to the new patriot’s articles of
impeachment against the Marquis of Wellesley on his return
from India. In view of the energetic tactics of the new
candidate and his allies, Sir Samuel Hood and Sheridan
thought it advisable to combine their interests, and make
a coalition for the occasion. The situation is pictorially
summed up as “The High-flying Candidate, Little Paull
Goose, mounting from a Blanket&mdash;<i>Vide</i> Humours of Westminster
Election” (November 11, 1806). Paull, according
to the ungenerous practice of all concerned, was taunted
with being the son of a tailor. Sir Samuel Hood, with one
arm lost in his country’s service, and Sheridan in sables for
his late friend, and with the farce of “The Devil Among the
Tailors” in his pocket, are together raising their high-flying
antagonist in the “Coalition Blanket.” The Admiral’s
sailors and patriotic volunteers for Sheridan are alike
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
pronouncing emphatically for the combined names of the
two senior candidates. At the feet of the Coalition members
is the memorial slab to departed greatness, “Sacred to the
Memory of Poor Charley, late member for the City of Westminster,”
“We ne’er shall look upon his like again;” the
monument is thrust aside by the outraged spirit of the
deceased patriot, who is in anguish exclaiming, “<i>O tempora!
O mores!</i>”</p>

<p>Gillray’s third caricature on the general election of
1806 exhibits a spirited panorama of the procession to the
hustings as “Posting to the Election: a Scene on the Road
to Brentford,” in which each of the candidates is hastening
in the way supposed to best characterize his prospects and
party: William Mellish, who enjoyed the interest of the
Coalition Ministry then in office, is driven in style, in a
dashing “Rule Britannia and the Bank” four-in-hand,
under the “Flag of Loyalty and Independence,” by Lord
Granville as coachman; Lords Temple and Castlereagh,
and the Marquis of Buckingham are perched behind; the
latter is giving a sly helping pull to the post-chaise and
pair in which is seated George Byng&mdash;“in the good old
Whig interest;” the head of Fox is displayed on the box
as “the good old Whig Block.” Prominent in the foreground
is the grand <i>mel&eacute;e</i> of the Coalition candidates for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Westminster&mdash;Sheridan and Sir Samuel Hood, mounted on
a prancing brewer’s horse, just escaped from the dray, with
panniers overflowing with gold pieces, and labelled, “Subscription
Malt and Hops from the Whitbread Brewery.”</p>

<p>Burdett’s ballad-singers and marrow-bone-and-cleaver
men are scattered by the plunging dray-horse from Whitbread’s,
and the startled donkey, which bears little Paull, is
giving the rider an upset, in which Paull’s famous “Impeachment
of the Marquis of Wellesley” is falling to the
ground. Last comes Sir Francis Burdett, who, on this
occasion, experienced a mortifying defeat in the face of his
former triumphs at Brentford; the gay barouche of 1800
and 1804 has given place to an “untaxed cart” with four
miserable jackasses; the efforts of a posse of sweeper-boy
followers with difficulty extricate this shabby conveyance
from the slough. Acting as postillion is the little Corsican,
Bonaparte, then but recently elected Emperor of the
French. It was at this time one of the theories of Napoleon
I., that, after the visionary conquest of England, he would
inaugurate a republic, for the presidency of which he
declared Sir Francis Burdett to be, in his estimation, the
fittest person in England; this opinion, it is believed, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
shared by the baronet&mdash;an entertaining aspect of the
“might-have-beens”! “Liberty and Equality, No Placemen
in Parliament, and No Bastilles,” are the watchwords
of the party in the condemned cart; all the members wear
“Liberty” favours in their hats. Burdett has “The Life
of Oliver Cromwell” for consultation
ready at hand; behind him
is his political preceptor, Horne
Tooke, shown in parsonic guise, and
Bosville with the “Rights of Man”
next his heart. Cobbett appears as
the “Radical Drummer,” beating up
recruits for Burdett and Paull, with
his “Political Register” and “Inflammatory
Letters.” “Orator Broad-face,
of Swallow Street,” whose mob
pleasantries overpowered the veteran
Sheridan at Covent Garden, is among
the baronet’s enthusiastic supporters.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW OF THE HUSTINGS IN COVENT GARDEN&mdash;WESTMINSTER ELECTION. 1806. BY J. GILLRAY.</p>
</div>

<p>It was at the Westminster election of 1806 that the
excitement culminated. This long and expensive contest
was fruitful in incidents. Gillray has produced the most
characteristic “View of the Hustings in Covent Garden.”
At the time this version appeared, Paull was at the head
of the poll; he is shown vigorously denouncing his discomfited
antagonist&mdash;“Harlequin Sherry” as “the sunk,
the lost, the degraded treasurer.” Immediately behind Paull
is the Duke of Northumberland, whose son, Lord Percy,
had relinquished Westminster after representing it in
parliament for one session, that immediately following
Fox’s decease; the Duke has “No Coalition” inscribed on
his hat, and a “Letter to the Vestry of St. Margaret’s” in
his hand. Cobbett, Burdett, and Bosville, wearing favours
for Paull, are in the front ranks of his supporters. Sheridan,
exhorted to “Pay your Debts, Mr. Treasurer,” is
represented as filled with consternation; Whitbread is
vainly trying to rally his spirits with his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>“New Loyal

Porter;” Sir Samuel Hood is seemingly ashamed of his
colleague, and is chuckling over his confusion. The exchange
of personalities between Paull and Sheridan, who
was assisted by the notorious “Pickle,” his son Tom,
exceeded all that had gone before, and degenerated into
“Billingsgate” abuse. Sheridan, with questionable propriety,
dwelt more particularly on the descent of his opponent
from “tailordom,” and was waggish in allusions to
the “ninth part of a man.” Paull complimented Sheridan
on “his good taste,” and justified it by referring to the
manager of Drury Lane as the “son of a vagabond,” actors
being by Act of Parliament classed in that category. Paull
was the readier at mob oratory, and Sheridan, “erst the
wit of the Commons,” found the hustings a terrible penance;
his appearance was the signal for violent uproar, and
requests for “renters’ shares” and sums of money owing,
and for which it was alleged he was liable. Painfully
conscious of his familiar embarrassments, this raillery,
in the presence of persons of credit and influence whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
support was growing lukewarm, broke down the spirit of
the veteran champion of this order of encounter. He had
trusted to his well-seasoned experience in mob demonstrations,
to his playful wit, apt jocularities, and sarcasms to
convert the mob to good humour, and to cajole them with
his popular persuasions into a friendly disposition; but he
reckoned without allowing for rivalry. Besides the fluent
Paull, there was one man in the crowd who fairly compelled
“Sherry” to retire abashed; in vain he tried by turns
ridicule and denunciation of “hireling ruffians,” the broad-faced
orator in the green coat seemed stimulated by these
counter-attacks. A comedy was then popular in which a
dandy was repeatedly quizzed by inquiries, directed to the
various portions of his apparel, of “Who suffers?” This
artillery was constantly played upon Sheridan: “Sherry,
I see you’ve got a new coat&mdash;who suffers?” “Sherry, who
suffers for that new hat?” After this the disconcerted
treasurer avoided the hustings, and his son Tom, whose
cool audacity was proverbial, managed to take his place.
Sheridan only gained the election through his coalition
with Hood; but the shafts of Cobbett’s “porcupine quills”
and the conflict of the hustings rankled in his breast. A
dissolution shortly followed, and he lost his seat, which, by
precipitating his financial difficulties, ingloriously finished
Sheridan’s career.</p>

<p>The defeat of the famous Coalition Ministry of “All the
Talents” upon the vexed question of Catholic Emancipation
was the cause of a fresh appeal to the country early
in 1807, when the followers of the late Granville Administration
contested the constituencies at a disadvantage,
confronted with the popular cries of “Church and King”
and “No Popery.” Paull now flattered himself that his
chances of being returned for Westminster were reviving,
but candidates were more numerous, and Sir Francis
Burdett, who was discouraged by his last experience from
contesting Middlesex, was appealing to Westminster himself.
Paull advertised a dinner to be held at the Crown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
and Anchor, and as Burdett had promised his support, and
had actually gone to the length of nominating Paull, he
was announced, without authority it appeared, to take the
chair; this was the cause of a rupture between the prominent
Radical candidates. Two days before the meeting,
Burdett wrote to Paull:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang">PATRIOTS DECIDING A POINT OF HONOUR; THE DUEL AT WIMBLEDON, BETWEEN
SIR FRANCIS BURDETT AND JAMES PAULL. WESTMINSTER ELECTION. 1807.
BY JAMES GILLRAY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“I must say, to have my name advertised for such meetings is like
‘Such a day is to be seen the great Katterfelto,’ and this without any
previous consent or application. From any one else I should regard
it as an insult!”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">At the dinner, it was explained by Sir Francis’s brother
that Burdett had given no promise to preside; after the
meeting broke up, Paull waited on his proposer, and a
warm altercation ensued, when a hostile meeting was
arranged to take place the next morning near Wimbledon.
This duel is made the subject of a fresh satire by Gillray&mdash;“Patriots
Deciding a Point of Honour! or, the Exact
Representation of the Celebrated Rencontre which took
place at Combe Wood on May 2nd, 1807, between Little
Paull the Tailor and Sir Francis Goose.” On the
field of honour, Burdett continued to be travestied as the
famous “great green goose:” his letter to the electors
at the Crown and Anchor is, with other political and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
personal publications, scattered around as the cause of the
encounter; one pair of pistols is already discharged. At the
second exchange of shots, which Paull demanded, as Burdett
declined to apologize, both combatants were wounded, as
shown in the picture. Sir Francis was highly indignant,
according to the satirist’s version: “What, must I be out!
and a Tailor get into Parliament?&mdash;You’re a liar! I never
said that I would sit as Chairman on your Shopboard!”
Paull, who is girt with a huge pair of shears sword-wise,
responds, “A liar!&mdash;Sir, I’m a Tailor and a Gentleman,
and I must have satisfaction.” Bellenden Kerr and Cooper,
the seconds of the respective combatants, are provided with
two armfuls of pistols for the emergency, which Sam
Rogers described as “ending in a lame affair.”</p>

Elliot, the brewer, as “Quassia,” is overset; Sheridan, in
his old Harlequin suit, is slipping down, never to rise

From the platform a select few of superannuated statesmen
are addressing the constituents, in this instance pictured as
calves. This version, which is by Gillray, represents a
phase of the “Patriotic Petitions on the Convention” (of
Cintra); “The Chelmsford Petition,” with Patriots addressing
the Essex Calves&mdash;who, it is notified, are “To be
sold to the highest bidder.” Lord Temple is unfolding the

Park guns; Armistice in French lingoes!” Earl St. Vincent
is appealing to the electors, and declaring that all the misfortunes
are due to the want of him; the gouty veteran is
supported by the Marquis of Buckingham, who is asserting
“It’s all for want of us, Gentlemen Calves!” sentiments
which the other occupants of the platform, Windham and
Lord Henry Petty, are applauding.</p>

<span class="medium">ELECTIONEERING CARTOONS AND SQUIBS, 1807-20.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">It was the “royal” Duke of Norfolk, who, on the
appeal to the country which followed the downfall of Lord
Granville’s Ministry of “all the Talents,” declared in the
true spirit of the old political grandees, “After all, what
greater enjoyment can there be in life than to stand a
contested election for Yorkshire, and to win it by one?”
The harder and more costly the fight, the better the fun,
and the more relishable the victory which stirred the
blood of the Howards.</p>

<p>It is curious to view the precise Wilberforce, as pictured
by himself, entertaining at midnight suppers his constituents,
the Hull freemen located in London, to the
number of three hundred, at waterside public-houses
round Wapping, and by his addresses to them “gaining
confidence in public speaking.” As a young man, only
just of age, Wilberforce successfully contested a seat for
Hull. His entry to the senate cost him between &pound;8000 and
&pound;9000, on his own showing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“By long-established custom the single vote of a resident elector
was rewarded with a donation of two guineas; four were paid for a
plumper, and the expenses of a freeman’s journey from London
averaged &pound;10 apiece. The letter of the law was not broken, because
the money was not paid until the last day on which election petitions
could be presented.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This early success of Wilberforce was won in opposition
to the paramount influence of Lord Rockingham, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
of the Government, “always strong at a seaport;” but this
contest sinks into insignificance beside Wilberforce’s later
experiences. It was after the philanthropist had already
represented the county of Yorkshire for twenty-three years
that, on the unexpected dissolution in 1807, he found
himself plunged in the most expensive contest on record,
one in which it was alleged half a million of money was
squandered, and which has been aptly designated the
“Austerlitz of Electioneering.”</p>

<p>Wilberforce’s opponents were Lord Milton, backed by
the powerful influence of his father, Earl Fitzwilliam, and
with the active co-operation of the Duke of Norfolk; and
the Hon. H. Lascelles, in promoting whose return his father,
Lord Harewood, was “ready to spend his whole Barbados
property.” When the great abolitionist arrived in York,
he found his rivals had already marshalled their forces,
retained all the law-agents, and engaged canvassers, houses
of entertainment, and every species of conveyance in any
considerable town. As Wilberforce assured his friends on the
nomination day, when nearly every hand was uplifted in
his favour, “he would never expose himself to the imputation
of endeavouring to make a seat in the House of
Commons subservient to the repair of a dilapidated
fortune,” a vast subscription was set on foot to defray the
expenses he incurred in standing, and, within a week, this
fund reached &pound;64,455. At the hustings, the high sheriff
declared the majority in favour of Lord Milton and the
Hon. H. Lascelles, whereupon a poll was demanded by
Mr. Wilberforce, which commenced at once, and continued
for fifteen days. The high sheriff presided in court, and
the poll was taken at thirteen booths in York Castle yard.
For the first few days Wilberforce stood so low that his
professional adviser stated that “the sooner he resigned the
better.” While the heavy purses had secured every mode
of conveyance, even to “mourning coaches,” Wilberforce’s
adherents were, at their own charges, slowly making their
way to the poll.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“No carriages are to be procured,” says a letter from Hull, “but
boats are proceeding up the river heavily laden with voters; farmers
lend their waggons; even donkeys have the honour of carrying voters
for Wilberforce, and hundreds are proceeding on foot. This is just
as it should be. No money can convey all the voters, but if their
feelings are roused his election is secure.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“How did you come up?” they asked a countryman who
had “plumped” for Wilberforce, and who denied having
spent anything on his journey. “Sure enow I cam all’d
way ahint Lord Milton’s carriage.” Vast hosts of mounted
freeholders rode in bodies to York, and, when interrogated,
“For what parties do you come?” the response was,
“Wilberforce” to a man, and these continued to arrive
both by day and night. The <i>York Herald</i> summarizes the
excitement of the election:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nothing since the days of the revolution has ever presented to
the world such a scene as this great county for fifteen days and
nights. Repose or rest have been unknown in it, except it was seen
in a messenger asleep upon his post-horse, or in his carriage. Every
day the roads in every direction to and from every remote part of the
county have been covered with vehicles loaded with voters; and
barouches, curricles, gigs, flying waggons, and military cars with eight
horses, crowded sometimes with forty voters, have been scouring the
country, leaving not the slightest chance for the quiet traveller to urge
his humble journey, or find a chair at an inn to sit down upon.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As Wilberforce’s majority increased, the “Miltonians”
and “Lascellites” freely resorted to tricky manœuvres
included among “election tactics.” Falsehoods about
“coalitions” were circulated; it was asserted there was
“an unholy alliance” between “Saint and Sinner”&mdash;Wilberforce
and Harewood House; that the great slave abolitionist
was in league with the “Nigger Driver,” otherwise Lord
Harewood, the holder of the Barbados slave property.
“Then,” says Wilberforce, “the mob-directing system&mdash;twenty
bruisers sent for, Firby, Gully, and others.” It was
the object of Milton’s “bravos” to drown Wilberforce’s
refutations of the “Coalition” charge, and when he
addressed the people, the mob interrupted his explanation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>“Print what you have to say in a handbill, and let them

read it, since they will not hear you,” cried a friend. “They
read indeed!” said Wilberforce. “What, do you suppose
that men who make such a noise as these fellows can read?”
This sally won the heart of the crowd. To the other false
rumours against him was added that of his own death; four
days before the election closed he was attacked by an
epidemic which disabled him from taking a further personal
share in the struggle. Wilberforce stood at the head of
the poll with 11,806 votes, Lord Milton was returned with
11,177, and Lascelles was defeated, with 10,989.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Had I not been defrauded of promised votes, I should have had
20,000,” Wilberforce wrote to Hannah Moore. “However, it is unspeakable
cause for thankfulness to come out of the battle ruined
neither in health, character, or fortune.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A large proportion of the subscriptions was returned.
The motives which influenced Wilberforce to this arduous
adventure are such as command the sympathies of those
who prize constitutional freedom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is but too manifest,” he wrote, “that expensive contests have
a natural tendency to throw great counties and populous places into
the hands of men of immense wealth; just as it has been sometimes
found that mankind have sought a refuge from the evils of anarchy,
by running into the opposite extreme, and surrendering their liberties.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In a footnote to a series of satirical epistles, published
in 1807, as “The Groans of the Talents,” in six epistles,
purporting to be written by ex-ministers to their colleagues,
we get a curious, if apocryphal, electioneering anecdote. The
putative author of the epistle in question, the Right
Hon. W. Windham, and his correspondent, T. W. Coke, were
both sufferers from the damaging indiscretion recorded. It
is explained how these candidates were supposed (incorrectly
according to facts) to have lost their seats for Norfolk. In
the general election, 1806, two ladies of the first respectability
drove about the county to canvass for Col. Hon. J.
Wodehouse (Conservative), and as they were universally
respected, their success was proportionably great. Messrs.
Coke and Windham were much chagrined at this circumstance;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
at length, however, the latter gentleman’s inventive
genius devised a plan by which he hoped to turn it to their
own advantage. Having procured two comely nymphs
of light reputation, somewhat resembling in age and
appearance the “fair petitioners” they were destined to
personate, he arrayed them in similar apparel, and, having
procured a carriage which formerly belonged to one of
these ladies, they canvassed another part of the county
in favour of Messrs. Coke and Windham; the trick, however,
was discovered, and so indignant were Col. Wodehouse’s
fair friends, that they instigated their husbands and friends
to petition parliament against the sheriff’s return. Thus
did the means by which Mr. Windham hoped to defeat the
Hon. John Wodehouse contribute to the discredit of himself
and friend. It must be added, it is hardly credible the
Right Hon. W. Windham would be likely to resort to so
disreputable an electioneering ruse.</p>

<p>In the days when candidates paid their electors’ travelling
expenses (and these ranged high, averaging, for example,
from London to Hull, ten pounds apiece for freemen,
the recognized tariff), curious manœuvres were resorted to
by the “other side;” one of these was to buy off the
persons who had the responsibility of delivering these
expensive cargoes safe and in good voting order at the end
of their expedition. Among these anecdotes, it is related
that, when those Berwick freemen who happened to reside
in the metropolis&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“were going down by sea, the skippers, to whose tender mercy
they were committed, used to be bribed, and have been known in
consequence to carry them over to Norway!”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">This is the forerunner of the Ipswich story, that the
Ipswich freemen, under precisely similar conditions, have
occasionally found themselves in Holland; while, on the
authority of R. Southey, it had also occurred to electors to
find themselves delivered at a port in the Netherlands. The
notorious Andrew Robinson Bowes, who was famous for
being undeterred by scruples, once stood for Newcastle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
A cargo of Newcastle freemen were shipped from London
for his opponent, and the master was bribed by Bowes to
carry them to Ostend, where they remained till the election
was over.</p>

<p>The majesty of the people is adequately represented
from a humoristic standpoint by Pugin and Rowlandson, as
it might have appeared on its septennial returns in the
boisterous eighteenth century. In the view of the most
celebrated polling-place of the kingdom, one of the candidates
has secured the ears of the adjacent crowd:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A man, when once he’s safely chose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May laugh at all his furious foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor think of former evil:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet good has its attendant ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A <i>seat</i> is no bad thing&mdash;but still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A <i>contest</i> is the devil.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Possibly the voices will follow; a show of hands is
offered with hearty goodwill; but, put to the test of the
poll-book, it would seem that, for the most part, the
audience is voteless. However, the polling-places may be
recognized, like cattle pens, in front of the hustings, with
the attendant officials under the supervision of the high
bailiff of Westminster as returning officer. The flags
indicate the respective parishes of the district, such as
St. Margaret’s, St. James’s, St. Martin in the Fields, etc.
Pugin is responsible for the literal exactitude with which
the locality is represented; his drawing may be accepted
as a faithful view of the customary arrangement of the
Covent Garden hustings at the time of the Westminster
elections: while Rowlandson has added the life and zest
of the subject from actual observation. With the history
of the famous contests held on this spot before us, it is noteworthy
that the artist has given prominence to one well-known
feature, characteristic of Westminster elections for
nearly a century, the nomination of an influential naval
officer in the Court interest, whose supporters, backed up
by a contingent of loyal jack-tars, produced a due effect on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
the opposition. Rowlandson was quite at home in the
scene: he has reproduced the bludgeon-boys, ballad-singers,
professional pugilists, marrow-bone-and-cleaver “rough
music,” and those vendors of cakes, nuts, fruit, and such
small wares as were in request at such times; these
itinerant traders found at elections a large mart for their
commodities, but the business was at such times conducted
at some personal risk, the baskets being overset, the contents
scattered, and the owners roughly handled in the course of
the attacks, counter-charges, and other party-manœuvres
which diversified the proceedings in the vicinity of the
hustings.</p>

<p>G. Cruikshank supplied a frontispiece to Fairburn’s
“Electors of Westminster,” 1810&mdash;a copy of the “Speaker’s
Warrant for the Commitment of Sir Francis Burdett to
the Tower,” with a burlesque portrait of that privileged
functionary, the Speaker, in an enormous wig, surmounted
by a miniature hat; the Right Hon. Charles Abbott was
further caricatured by the artist as “The Little Man in
the Big Wig”&mdash;<i>vide</i> “Fuller’s Earth reanimated.”</p>

<p>A burlesque, by George Cruikshank, upon one of the
candidates for the City appeared in 1812, under the title
of “The Election Hunter;” it consists of a broadside,
commencing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ve just learned, by the porter who stands at my door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That your old friend, Sir Charles, means to offer no more.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">G. Cruikshank has supplied the pictorial embellishments.
Sir Claudius Hunter, the canvassing candidate, is standing
in the stirrups of his famous charger, “White Surrey,”
mounted on the platform, attended by masked horsemen,
and squired by a dilapidated knight in armour, who has
evidently seen overmuch service. The candidate is thus
addressing the civic constituency: “Gentleman, I earnestly
solicit your vote and interest for me and my horse.”
This appeal the electors receive with derision, “No, no;
you may saddle White Surrey for Cheapside if you like,
but not for the House,” “Off, off,” etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>This electioneering squib was probably preceded by
another, also designed by G. Cruikshank (published April 10,
1812). In this version, entitled, “Saddle White Surrey for
Cheapside to-morrow&mdash;W. Lon. Mil. Regt. [West London
Militia Regiment], General Orders,” Sir Claudius, mounted
on his steed, is making, like a true knight-errant, a
quixotic charge upon his constituents, preceded by the
woeful man-in-armour, like Sancho Panza, on an ass; he
is charging the throng with his lance. A groom behind Sir
Claudius is exclaiming, “This is our High-bred Hunter!”</p>

<p>In 1812, G. Cruikshank found fresh exercise for his
etching-needle on another electioneering cartoon&mdash;“The
Borough Candidates,” published October 1812. Suggestions
of Gillray will be identified in this plate, for the artist is
dealing with Charles Calvert, the brewer, who was elected
for Southwark with H. Thornton, in opposition to W. J.
Burdett; the new member is seated astride a barrel of his
own brewing, the “stingo” is pouring forth from spigot and
vent-peg. The discomfited candidates are figured on either
side; while the heads of the brewer’s constituents appear
in front.</p>

<p>Elections happily brought both food and occupation to
the caricaturists and satirists, as it has been shown.
Incidents connected with this subject evidently caught the
popular taste, for we find Cruikshank making the most of
the mere title, in association with the etching of a somewhat
commonplace presentment of a country assembly-room,
conveying no flattering impression of the provincial
grace and deportment of the period; this was published in
1813&mdash;as “An Election Ball:” the floor is occupied by
knock-kneed dancers doddering through figures, while the
master of the ceremonies is shouting his instructions to
the leader of the band, elevated in an orchestra overhead.</p>

<p>The artist evidently found this topic remunerative, for
in 1819 he produced a smaller version of “An Election
Ball”&mdash;a similar subject, with the arrangement of the
room reversed; a country dance is proceeding with “hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
across;” the clumsy master of the ceremonies, who is
pigeon-toed, stands viewing the scene with evident gratification.
This plate reappeared, with a new publisher’s name,
in 1835 (republished by Thomas McLean, Haymarket).</p>

</div>

<p>Both Robert and George Cruikshank were working
away on the popular side of the Westminster election
contest, June 18, 1818. “The Freedom of Election; or,
<span class="smcap">Hunting</span> for Popularity, and Plumpers for <span class="smcap">Maxwell</span>,”
published June 22, 1818, owes its origin to this combination
of talent. In the caricature, the candidates and their
most prominent supporters are mounted on the Covent
Garden hustings, of which a front view is given. Hunt
stands hat in hand (he and Sir Francis Burdett sport
“favours”); the Radical reformer is backed by his colours,
his flag proclaims “Universal Suffrage and Liberty;”
the standard is surmounted by a cap of liberty. Hunt
is making a characteristically downright appeal to his
audience:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am a plain Englishman. I approve of the conduct of Sir Murray
Maxwell in coming forward as he has done. Why should you send
Sir Samuel Romilly to Parliament? He can find his way into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
Den of Corruption. You know the hero of the Tower, as well as I do&mdash;who
ran out at the back door when his friends were waiting for him
at the front. <i>I</i> have hoisted the Cap of Liberty!”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The followers of the speaker are shouting, “Hunt for ever!
no Sovereigns, no Regents, no Churches, no Lawyers!
Universal Plunder for ever! No Sham Patriots. Hunt
and Liberty. Hunt and Revolution.” Sir Francis Burdett
comes next, beside the Hon. Douglas Kinnaird and
Major Cartwright; these candidates are variously received.
“Burdett for ever!&mdash;No Weathercocks. No Coalition.
The Spenceans for ever! Napoleon for ever! Burdett
for ever! No Spafields Rioters.” “Kinnaird for ever!”
“Cartwright for ever! No old woman in Parliament.” Sir
Samuel Romilly is standing beside the poll on which the
results of the first day’s votings are recorded. The cries
for “Romilly and Justice,” “Romilly and Reform,” indicate
a popular candidate. Sir Murray Maxwell is a prominent
figure, and is represented in the full swing of his eloquence;
like Hunt, he is disposed to be a courteous opponent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Gentlemen,&mdash;Mr. Hunt is anxious you should hear me now. I
am certain you will hear him presently with pleasure. I am certain
my cause is as popular as his; for I see many pretty girls pressing
forward to hear me. Of all the days in the year, none appear more
favourable for a British officer to receive your support than the anniversary
of Waterloo.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“Maxwell and the British Navy! Let every man do his
duty!” is shouted; while hostile voices cry, “No Maxwell&mdash;no
Captain Flog-’em.” A notice-board, capped by the
crown, sets forth the merits of this candidate:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Who is Sir M. Maxwell? He is a brave, learned, loyal, and
Constitutional man. He hoists only the colours of his King and
country&mdash;not the red flag. He has engaged to pay his share of the
Hustings to prevent new levies on the people.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Sir S. Romilly (W) headed the poll with 5339 votes; Sir
Francis Burdett was a good second with 5238; Sir Murray
Maxwell, the unsuccessful candidate, polled 4808: the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
others were “nowhere”&mdash;Hunt, 84; Kinnaird, 65; Cartwright,
23.</p>

<p>There appeared in 1819 “A Political Squib on the
Westminster Election, Covent Garden” (March 3), by G.
Cruikshank. This etching forms the frontispiece to a tract
published April 20, 1819, for Bengo, print-dealer, Maiden
Lane, Covent Garden. The somewhat mystifying title of
the election squib is “Patriot Allegory, Anarchical Fable,
and Licentious Parody,” and it purports to be written by
Peregrine Castigator. G. Cruikshank has availed himself
of that long-suffering animal, the British Lion; in this instance
the monarch of the beasts personates the successful
candidate, the Hon. George Lamb being figured as the lion.
He is exhibited standing under the city gate, beneath a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
portcullis, wreathed with laurels; his tail is lashed in anger,
while the unsuccessful candidates, as an additional ignominy
to their defeat, are travestied as the heads of a
hydra trampled beneath their political victor. John Cam
Hobhouse (W) polled 3,861, and was beaten by G. Lamb (C)
with 4,465 votes. T. T. Wooler, the revolutionary publisher,
for whom Cruikshank was working in 1815, is
personified as the “Black Dwarf,” as his whilom ally ever
after represented him; his duck’s-head cap is made to
exclaim, “Cartwright and ’38!!!” the next individual says,
“Quack! quack! quack!”&mdash;an allusion to the small minority
of votes polled by the Radical candidate at the Westminster
election for 1819, vice Romilly deceased, when 8,364 votes
were registered, and only 38 of these for Cartwright.</p>

<p>Major Cartwright, the “Drum-major of Sedition” of the
ministerial satirists, was one of the Radical reformers who
laboured actively for the reform of parliamentary abuses.
He put up for Westminster in the Radical interest in 1818
and 1819, but seems to have had no support. In 1820,
Major Cartwright addressed a petition to the House of
Commons for the purpose of disclosing “that ninety-seven
Lords usurped two hundred seats in the Commons-House
in violation of our Laws and Liberties.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Resolved.</i> That it is a high infringement upon our Liberties and
Privileges for Lords of Parliament to concern themselves in the Elections
of members to serve for the Commons.” (<i>Journals at the commencement
of every Session.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">How far the measure of reform was needed in the corrupt
system of boroughmongering is clearly demonstrated by
Major Cartwright’s&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“Lists and Tables of Peers of the Realm who have unlawfully concerned
themselves in the Election of members to serve for the Commons
in the Parliament which was then sitting (1820), with the Counties and
Towns where the unlawful interference of Peers has operated, either
by nomination or influence, with the number of members unlawfully
returned.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">For instance, the Dukes of Bedford and Rutland respectively
returned four representatives; the same number was in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
nomination of the Earls of Ailesbury, St. Germans, Mount
Edgecumbe, etc., while such powerful autocrats as the Earl
of Lonsdale contrived to return eight nominees, as did the
Earl of Darlington; six members were returned by the Duke
of Norfolk and Earl Fitzwilliam respectively; while the
Dukes of Devonshire, Newcastle, and Northumberland, the
Marquises of Buckingham and Hertford, the Earl of
Powis, and Baron Carrington each managed to return five
seats. To the calculations given in his table, the petitioner
added the Treasury patronage, then in the Earl of Liverpool’s
control, giving eleven members; the Admiralty, under
Viscount Melville’s patronage, imposing three members, the
Ordnance (Duke of Wellington) one&mdash;adding again, according
to the calculations given in Oldfield’s “Representative
History” (vi. 289),&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“There are ninety wealthy Commoners who, for 102 vile sinks of corruption
over which they tyrannize, further dishonour the House by
forcing on it 137 members,” thus giving a total of no less than 353
members, who, as Cartwright represented to the House of Commons
in his very remarkable Petition, [the Major writes] “to use the words
of the royal proclamation of the 30th July, 1819,” were created such
“in gross violation of the law, and to the palpable subversion of the
constitution, being corruptly or tyrannically imposed on the Commons.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“The pure and undefiled principles of the Constitution”
were inculcated by Major Cartwright in his “Lectures on
the British Constitution,” “Letters to Lord Mayor Wood,”
“Letters to Clarkson on African and English Freedom,”
“Resolutions and Proceedings of the Hampden Club,” “A
Bill of Rights and Liberties; or, an Act for restoring the
Civil Branch of the Constitution,” and the companion work,
“A Bill of Free and Sure Defence, for restoring the Military
Branch.” The major was brimming over with zeal, and
had almost too good a case; unfortunately for the enforcement
of his reforms, he was too early in the field.</p>

<p>The coming elections of 1820 were preceded by several
caricatures. Those by George Cruikshank are the most
meritorious, the artist’s work for this date being at its best.
He was at that time employed by Humphrey, the print-publisher,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
of St. James’s Street, as a successor to James
Gillray, an honour the artist regarded with pride to the
close of his long career. On the 1st of January, John Cam
Hobhouse, who was then canvassing Westminster, and was
this year to be sent to parliament as the colleague of his
friend, Sir Francis Burdett, was exhibited as “Little Hob
in the Well,” under the title of “A Trifling Mistake&mdash;Corrected.”
The diminutive statesman is exhibited in the
place of his confinement, a prison-cell; he is gloomily contemplating
two pictures on the wall, “St. Stephen’s Chapel
<i>versus</i> Newgate.” A pile of manuscripts, blackened by the
upsetting of an inkstand, and a mouse-trap assist the allusions.
“The Trifling Mistake” is placarded on the wall
in the indiscreet but pertinent utterances of the captive,
which, if truly set forth, may account for his incarceration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“What prevents the people from walking down to the House and
pulling out the members by the ears, locking up their doors, and flinging
the key into the Thames? Is it any majesty which lodges in the
members of that assembly? Do we love them? Not at all; we have
an instinctive horror and disgust at the abstract idea of a boroughmonger.
Do we respect them? Not in the least. Do we regard them
as endowed with any superior qualities? On the contrary, individually,
there is scarcely a poorer creature than your mere member
of Parliament, though in his corporate capacity the earth furnishes not
so absolute a bully. Their true practical protectors, then&mdash;the real
efficient anti-Reformers&mdash;are to be found at the Horse Guards and the
Knightsbridge Barracks. As long as the House of Commons majorities
are backed by the regimental muster-roll, so long may those who
have got the tax-power keep it,&mdash;and hang those who resist.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same month appeared another strong “anti-reform”
caricature from the same source&mdash;though, as we
see by a later work, the artist’s sympathies were at this
time on the side of the reformers, while Radical publishers
of an advanced type were his chief employers,&mdash;“The Root
of King’s Evil&mdash;Lay the Axe to it,” January 14, 1820. A
learned prelate, seated in his library, is considerably scared
by the apparition of the red spectre, literally a root&mdash;possibly
implying the tree of liberty&mdash;planted in “le bonnet
rouge,” and wearing the cap of liberty. On a pike in one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
hand is the mitred head of a bishop, in the other is another
pike surmounted by a battered crown, with the tricolour flag
edged with crape, and inscribed “Blood, Reform, and Plunder,”
with a list of the “reds” and reformers in juxtaposition&mdash;Watson,
Thistlewood, Preston, Hooper, Waddington,
Harrison, Hunt, Pearson, Wood, Waithman, Parkins, etc.
In the second category are Cobbett, Carlile, Tom Paine,
Burdett, Little Hob, Death, and the Devil,&mdash;no King, etc.
The prelate is interrogating the spectral visitor: “In the
name of Satan, what the Devil are you, and where were you
hatched?” “In Hell, your worship. I’m a Radical. Give
me leave to present you a list of my best friends.” “Burn’s
Justice” stands open at “Treason,” and a huge volume of
“Etymology” stands exposed at the definition of “Radical”&mdash;“<i>Ex
Radix</i> is a root, and <i>Calor</i> is heat, anger, strife; <i>q.d.</i>&mdash;The
root of all strife.”</p>

<p>A comprehensive view of the respective sections of
Radicals and Reformers on the dissolution of Parliament,
February 29, 1820, is afforded by one of G. Cruikshank’s
most successful caricatures, which may be considered, in
point of execution, as among the works most worthy of his
reputation; it is entitled, “Coriolanus Addressing the Plebs,”
February 29, 1820. The scene is the screen in front
of Carlton House Palace, and His Majesty, the magnifico
George IV., is flatteringly travestied as Coriolanus.
The “cauliflower” wig and false whiskers affected by
“the finest gentleman in Europe” detract from the consistency
of the figure, otherwise attired in classic guise,
and presenting a dignified appearance; for, wonderful to
relate, Cruikshank has gone out of his way to compliment
the king in more than one respect. The address, a felicitous
quotation from Shakespeare, is antagonistic to the
actual sentiments held by the artist at this stage of his
career:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“What would ye have, ye curs, that like not peace nor war? The
one affrights you, the other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
where he should find you lions, finds you hares; where foxes, geese.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Hang ye! trust ye!! With every minute you change a mind, and
call him noble that was now your hate; him vile, that was your garland.
What’s the matter, that in the several places of the city, you
cry against the noble Senate, who (under the gods) keep you in awe,
which else would feed upon one another?”</p></blockquote>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 338.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Beneath the quotation is a passage from Buffon, eulogizing
the nobility of the figure above, “L’image de l’&acirc;me est
peinte par la physionomie”&mdash;“anim&eacute; d’un feu divin,” and
other extravagances, such as “his majestic presence, and
the firm and bold deportment which marks his nobility
and rank.” In the other “Great George’s” parody, the
various sections, from Reformers to Revolutionists and
Socialists, are carefully kept apart, although the plebeians
at the first glance appear but a miscellaneous mob.</p>

<p>First comes “Liberty of the Press,” a tricolour standard,
topped by the “cap of liberty.” At the front stands William
Hone, a stalwart champion, armed with two formidable
clubs, one is styled “Parody,” and the other inscribed with
the names of the famous satirical tracts, “The Man in the
Moon,” and “The House that Jack Built,” both objectionable
weapons in the eyes of the “Coriolanus” of the
picture. Behind his ally and publisher, Hone, is the
portrait of the artist himself, with a tricoloured portfolio
marked “Caricature.” George Cruikshank, in his later
days, when turned to Tory proclivities like one or two
other notabilities in the group, endeavoured to soften the
impression conveyed by this print, and described “your
humble servant” as “one of the moderate reformers,”
evidently not relishing the company of those among whom,
in his early truculent days, he had voluntarily enrolled
himself. Next comes the figure of the champion of the
Princess of Wales, “Sheriff Double Hue,” otherwise
Waithman, who is hugging a project for “Hell-wide
Measures;” beneath the standard of the “Examiners”
and “Chronicles” stands a figure clad in complete Highland
garb; this is Douglas Kinnaird, on the alert, and
armed with his trusty claymore. Sir Francis Burdett
and John Cam Hobhouse, jointly grasping a formidable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
weapon, are enlisted under the standard of “Parliamentary
Reform.” Hobhouse is trampling on the “Trifling
Mistake,” a parodied version of the speech which procured
him more notoriety than was desirable: over his head is
seen Thelwall as a champion lecturer; Major Cartwright,
the so-called “Drum-Major of Sedition,” after all his
struggles in the cause, is but a broken-down leader,
supported on a crutch stick with one hand, while raising
the redoubtable sword of “Universal Suffrage” in the
other. Prominent in front of the group enlisted under
the ensign of “Revolution and Plunder,” capped with the
Death’s head, stands Wooler, travestied as the “Black
Dwarf,” after the paper he had then made notorious.
Orator Hunt, with pike reversed, is resting one hand on
Cobbett’s shoulder; the latter, a brawny figure, flourishing
two gigantic bones (of contention?); another communist
is skulking away, having let fall Tom Paine’s “Age of
Reason.” The publisher of the “new lights,” Carlile,
is resting on a staff capped with a thistle; Preston, the
bootmaker, a violent Democrat, together with Thistlewood
and others holding extreme views, are enrolled under a
bond of “Blood and Plunder.” The figure to the extreme
left, next to the screen of Carlton House, is described by
Cruikshank as intended for Dr. Watson. Truly the
“Plebs” form a muster-roll of all the prominent Radicals
and Revolutionists of a period when secret societies of
those whose designs were inimical to constitutional order
were presumed to flourish.</p>

<p>The evils which disfigured constituencies in the boroughmongering
days are pictorially set forth by George Cruikshank,
under date April 23, 1820, in a caricature entitled
“Freedom and Purity of Election!!! Showing the Necessity
of Reform in the Close Boroughs.” The scene refers to the
elections in Cornwall; the locality being indicated by a signpost
as Tregony and St. Austel. The unhappy villagers, by
the independent exercise of their suffrages, have displeased
their feudal proprietor, and are being summarily evicted
from their houses, with their household belongings, by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
truculent steward, with a list of the “proscribed” held in
his hand. Old and young, women and children, are alike
doomed, because they or their protectors have dared to act
with independence, and have not voted according to the
fiat of the lord of the manor. Daniel O’Connell appears
as the unsuccessful candidate; he is viewing this mischief
with compassion, and is encouraging those evicted “not to
be cast down, as there are other houses besides his lordship’s,”
and that he&mdash;the Liberator&mdash;“will not desert
them, although they have lost the election.”</p>

<p>Parliament reassembled at the end of April, 1820, and
in May, George Cruikshank again favoured the public with
another anti-reform cartoon, “Radical Quacks giving a
New Constitution to John Bull!” In this version the
persons most prominent among the “Plebeians” are
alluded to incidentally. John Bull, the national prototype,
is reduced, under the new “regimen,” out of all
recognition; in fact, he is but the mangled remnant of
his former portly self, for the new charlatans are having
“their own sweet will.” John Bull is placed between
Burdett and Hobhouse; many desperate operations have
already taken place. He wears the bonnet-rouge of
“Liberty” as a night-cap. His left arm is in a tricoloured
sling, while his right arm is being bled. His two sufficient
supports of Church and State have been amputated, and
in their places are strapped two wooden-legs&mdash;“Universal
Suffrage,” propped on the “Rights of Man,” and “Religious
Freedom,” which is raised on the “Age of Reason;” the
legs of his invalid-chair are equally unreliable&mdash;“Mistaken
Confidence,” and “Mistaken Security;” the sufferer is
resting on a pillow stuffed with “False Promises” and
“Reformers’ Opinions.” Sir Francis Burdett, as a professional
adviser, is holding the arm from which he is
draining the patient’s blood:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Bull, you have lived too well, but when we have renovated
your constitution according to our plan, the reform will be so complete&mdash;that
you will never again be troubled with any fulness whatsoever!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">John Cam Hobhouse is administering a tricoloured bolus
of formidable dimensions, to be followed by a corresponding
draught:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Never mind, Mr. Bull; if we have thought it necessary to take
off both your legs, you will find the others very good substitutes; this
Revolutionary Bolus and decoction of disloyalty are very harmless,
but they will restore the <i>general equality</i> of the intestines and remove
any obstruction which may prevent us from effecting a Radical Reform
in the system.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The victim of these experiments is by no means assured as
to his future&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Maybe, gentlemen,” he replies to these plausible assurances;
“but you have taken all the honest good blood out of my veins;
deprived me of my real supporters, and stuck two bad props in their
place, and if you go on thus, I shall die before ever my constitution
can be improved.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The real supporters, “Mr. Bull’s two legs&mdash;Church and
State,” are consigned to a coffin, “to be entombed in the
vaults of St. Stephen’s Chapel.” A formidable array of
nostrums are displayed in the vicinity: Burdett has soporifics
and opiates handy&mdash;a huge bottle, labelled “Burdett’s
Mixture,” contains a red, white, and blue republican decoction,
“Hobhouse’s Newgate-proof Purity,” and “Whitbread’s
Entire;” a large packet of “Cartwright’s Universal
Grease,” with a phial of “Wooler’s Black-drops;” “Old
Bailey Drops” (the bottle broken); ditto, “Dr. Watson’s
White + Comfort;” a packet of “Hunt’s Powder,” and
a full supply of “Cobbett’s Hellebore Ratsbane”&mdash;enough,
in all conscience, to kill or cure.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="medium">ELECTIONEERING, POLITICAL WARFARE, AND PARLIAMENTARY
REFORM UNDER WILLIAM IV., 1830-32.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">The last parliament of George IV.’s reign met November
14, 1826. Towards the close of the session, as is
shadowed in Doyle’s early cartoons, the nation was tiring
of the Tories, and the unpopular and somewhat antiquated
Wellington Ministry found the country in distress and
clamorous for retrenchment, to each of which complaints
the rigid disciplinarian in chief command turned a deaf
and unsympathetic ear. Towards the middle of the year
1830 the king’s condition was threatening, and with his
impending decease the close of the session was anticipated.
The situation is pictorially summed up in one of HB’s
sketches as the “Present State of Public Feeling Partially
Illustrated” (May 28, 1830). The views entertained by
various individuals upon the king’s illness are illustrated
in their persons: a dandy regrets the postponement of
routs and balls, a speculator complains of the dulness of
the funds, a merchant finds business at a standstill, while
a lady of fashion is resigned to the will of Providence by
the opportune reflection that should the king die there
would be the gayer prospect of a queen and Court&mdash;an
advantageous exchange for a sovereign shrouded from his
subjects. John Bull good-naturedly declares he hopes
George may recover, “he was such a fine princely fellow!”
But the part of this picture which applies most pertinently
to the subject in hand is found in a member of the Tory
Government, who is reflecting “That should there be a
change in the ministry&mdash;then I must walk out. That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
would be very inconvenient at the present. I wish most
sincerely His Majesty won’t die yet!” while another M.P.
is filled with apprehension: “There will he a dissolution of
parliament, and I shall lose my seat, and with it all chance
of preferment. Oh, I pray God to preserve His Majesty’s
life these many years.” Swiftly indeed, and somewhat
unexpectedly too, came the end of the king’s reign and the
inauguration of a more liberal <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.</p>

<p>The next day appeared HB’s version of the “Mourning
Journal&mdash;Alas! Poor Yorick” (May 29, 1830), showing
the Duke of Cumberland and Lord Eldon as mutes in
attendance on the (to them) melancholy occasion of their
chief’s decease. “The Magic Mirror, or a Peep into
Futurity” (June 8, 1830), shows a magician favouring
John Bull with the prospect he might anticipate: the
youthful Princess Victoria becoming the point of contention
on the one hand between her mother, the Duchess of Kent,
and her uncle, Prince Leopold, of Liberal proclivities, and
the Tory pressure of her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland,
assisted by the Duke of Wellington, on the other.</p>

<p>While the dissolution was impending, Doyle indicated
the revival of Whig prospects, “The Gheber worshiping
the Rising Sun” (July 6, 1830) shows Mr. (afterwards
Lord) Brougham paying his devotions to “William IV.
Rex,” the head of the king on the gold coin, known as
“a coronation medal,” rising over the waters, and taking
the place of the orb of day. Parliament dissolved on
July 24th. Owing to some intrigues of the old campaigner
at this emergency, the Duke of Wellington was made to
appear as “A Detected Trespasser,” ordered off the slopes
of Windsor by “John Bull, Ranger:” “Halloa, you sir;
keep off the grass (see anecdote, <i>Times</i>, July 19th).”</p>

<p>Another pictorial version of strategies in high life is
entitled “Anticipation; or, Queen Sarah’s visit to Bushy”
(July 27, 1830). At the door of the Lodge at Bushy, where
resided the Duke and Duchess of Clarence, is the carriage
of Lady Jersey, with attendants in her handsome liveries.

One of her footmen is imparting the unwelcome intelligence,
“Duchess not at home, my lady.” The Duke of Wellington,
who is on horseback at the other side of the carriage, is
consoling Lady Jersey’s disappointment: “Never mind,
never mind, I’ll get you a key to what is going on here
thro’ my dear little St. James’s Marchioness.” The
duchess’s footman, in the royal livery, cannot fathom
the intrigue: “I wonder what brings her down here now?
I have been in this place these twelve years, and never saw
her here before!”</p>

</div>

<p>What unknown marvels might be anticipated from the
combinations of party, is hinted in the “<i>Un</i>-Holy Alliance,
or An Ominous Conjunction” (July 29, 1830), showing the
Duke of Cumberland and Lords Durham, Grey, and Eldon
in close confabulation. “Old Bags,” as the whilom lord
chancellor was irreverently christened, is characteristically
“laying down the law,” for the enlightenment of his
comrades in this strangely assorted quartette.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p>A general and somewhat conventional satire on the
possible conduct of candidates before, upon, and after their
return, appeared among the “Election Squibs and Crackers
for 1830,” “Look on this Picture, and on that.” “General
Election&mdash;dedicated to Electors in General&mdash;the difference
between one hour after the return, and one month after.”
The voter represented is evidently a prosperous mechanic;
he wears the colours of the newly elected one in his hat,
and is thus addressed by the member he has contributed to
return: “My worthy, my best friend, it will be my constant
study to comply with your wishes&mdash;how can I serve you?
Let me see you often; pray come to the Hall; we shall be
so happy to see you.” This overcoloured state of things
is strangely altered within a month; the candidate is now
a full member, and is evidently studying his own interests
to the exclusion of those of his constituents; in his hand
is a peremptory Government “whip,” thus worded:
“Ministers wishing to pass the measure, your vote will be
required.” The legislation in question appears to threaten
the welfare of his late enthusiastic supporter, who has
ventured to interview his member on the momentous topic:
“Sir, there is a Bill about to pass that will quite ruin our
trade, and bring our families to beggary. I hope, sir, you
will use your influence to throw it out.” The member now
wears an indignant expression: “You are an impudent
fellow! I don’t know you, and, if I did, do you suppose
I should be dictated to, fellow?” This plate was executed
by William Heath, and issued by T. McLean, of the
Haymarket. Perhaps the most notable feature is an
announcement that “Election caricatures can be executed
for gentlemen in three hours.” This advertisement,
appended to the caricature in question, is curious. Of
course, for a not-extravagant consideration, intending
candidates could secure the playful services of William
Heath for rendering ridiculous or contemptible the persons
and principles of their antagonists, and for the exaltation
of their own.

<p>Political satirists, happily for themselves, as a rule
(with one or two exceptions, such as Sayer and HB) have
soared above mere party distinctions; and though it may
at first sight strike the observer as indicating a looseness
of principles&mdash;rather, say, a freedom from prejudices&mdash;that
each gifted artist seems to lash and laugh at both sides
alternately to the best of his abilities, some allowance
must be made for the impartiality which enables these
latter-day Juvenals to detect the foibles of either faction.
As a rule, it may be assumed the old generation of famous
caricaturists, taking Gillray, Rowlandson, and George
Cruikshank as the most eminent exponents, rather leaned
to the popular side of any given question; but, inclination
apart, they were just as capable of glorifying “the powers
that be,” and of “dusting the jackets” of the would-be
reformers. Of this trio, Cruikshank particularly prided
himself, as he has himself recorded, upon espousing the
side of right against palpable wrong, and of championing
the weak against the strong. But, in spite of this pleasing
illusion, his caricatures are equally trenchant on either
side&mdash;to-day the Regent is demolished, to-morrow his
unfortunate wife is held up to opprobrium, with happy
nonchalance and impartiality. In fact, it may be said of
Gillray, as the specimens of his ability in this direction
sufficiently demonstrate, that his pictorial satires against
Pitt and the Tories were equalled only by his satires
directed against Fox and the Whigs, or the youthful
Burdett and the Radical reformers of his earlier day.</p>

<p>Apropos of the same general elections, we find our old
friends, Sir Francis Burdett and his whilom preceptor and
champion, William Cobbett, of <i>Political Register</i> repute,
engaged in what the artist delineates as “A <i>Character</i>-istic
Dialogue” (September 2, 1830). “Peter Porcupine,”
having parliamentary aspirations, is applying to his
ancient pupil and ally for a voucher: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>“Being much in
want of a character, I make bold, Sir Francis, to ask you
for one; it appearing that your benevolence in this way

embraces all sorts of criminals, you cannot consistently
refuse me!” Burdett, in spite of this touching reference
to his exertions on behalf of the prisoner inmates of
Coldbath Fields, is turning a haughty front to the applicant:
“I cannot do anything for you; your character is already
<i>Registered</i>.” With the reformed parliament, Cobbett was
returned for Oldham. In the House he disappointed
expectations, and was regarded as somewhat in the light
of a failure.</p>

<p>The usual changes of seats had taken place in the
course of the elections, and it was hinted that the
Wellington-Peel Administration might find it expedient to
increase its strength by the infusion of new blood, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
view to the “power-to-add-to-their-numbers” policy. The
chiefs still in office are shown by Doyle as visiting “The
Noodle Bazaar” (September 9, 1830, Q. and HB delt.).
Reviewing the files of various assorted “bustoes,” Wellington,
using his eye-glass, is observing to his colleague,
“Peel, I am in great want of a few good heads to place in
our Cabinet before the opening of the new House in October,
and I see some here which I think would answer, if they
could be had on reasonable terms.” Peel, alive to the
results of the elections, is replying, “I perceive that the
places of some have been changed, and their value raised
since I last saw them, and pray observe the strange
mixture of heads upon the <i>upper shelf</i>.” The Peers who,
according to the notification below them, “May be had
separately or together,” occupy the upper shelf, and below
is a cabinet of busts for sale, ready assorted. The shelved
lords offer a motley choice: Lords Grey, Eldon, Holland,
Lansdowne, the Duke of Cumberland, etc.,&mdash;all statesmen
out of work. Below the upper shelf is a platform on
which is an assorted ready-made ministry (of busts)
arranged in a regular order. “This group is to be sold in
one lot. Every head has its price marked on it.” The
respective busts represent Huskisson (president of the Board
of Trade), Grant (colonies), Palmerston (foreign secretary),
Melbourne (home secretary), etc. On a pedestal marked
“Yorkshire, to wit,” is the brazen bust of Henry Brougham,
the plinth with the word “Rolls” struck out in favour
of “Chancery.” The bust of Hume in marble stands
on a square and massive pediment, marked “Middlesex.”
O’Connell is below in clay; he is thus ticketed: “This
head won’t be sold&mdash;(until it be bought).” A row of lesser
men on a shelf in the distance bears the advertisement,
“These small busts may be had remarkably cheap.” The
bust of Charles X. is just upset; while, on a high plinth,
marked “The People’s Choice&mdash;a French pattern of
inestimable value,” stands his successor, Louis Philippe.
The Dey of Algiers is also thrown aside, while Lords
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Manners, Redesdale, and Sidmouth are among the
“antiques,” obsolete patterns, and “oddments.”</p>

<p>The proverbial independence of John Bull’s character
is playfully called in question (September 10, 1830), the
national prototype being represented (not for the first or
last time) as “The man wot is easily led by the nose.”
The <i>Times</i> is the potential leading organ to which John
Bull is attached in the way described; he is exclaiming, in
happy delusion, “What a glorious thing it is to enjoy the
liberty and independence of an Englishman!”</p>

<p>The displacement of the Wellington-Peel Cabinet followed
a little later on. We next see the Duke of Cumberland
surrendering office: “Resignation and Fortitude; or,
the Gold Stick.” The king is seated busied in State
affairs, the ex-Gold Stick, handing in the wand of office,
is remarking, “I have now only to cut my stick and be
off!” William IV., still pen in hand, replies briefly,
“Thank ye, brother, thank ye,” being evidently reconciled
both to his situation and the enormous sacrifice involved.</p>

<p>Incidentally we find a reference to the general election
which was then engaging public attention; Doyle has
ingeniously given a novel turn to his view of one of the
candidates, by introducing a comparison with a performer
who was also enjoying popular notice, “The Rival Candidates”
(August 9, 1830). There are two hustings erected,
and the crowd of free and independent electors is filling the
intervening space. The satire is evidently aimed at Sir
Alexander Grant, who, standing in front of his committee,
is pointing, with a self-satisfied air, to his chin, of which
Doyle has made the most. His rival is Michel Boai, “the
musical wonder,” a Tyrolese performer, who “played
tunes on his chin” by sheer muscular force. He is shown
hammering his nether jaw with his fists, and giving a
specimen of his chin-proficiency, supported by another
minstrel with a small violin. Boai’s performance has won
the sympathies and suffrages of his audience, who have
with one accord turned their backs upon Sir A. Grant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
and are applauding the new musical marvel. Boai’s agent
is skilfully “working the oracle” while drawing attention
to the rival booth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The hon<sup>ble</sup> Gentleman opposite has certainly a most extraordinary
chin, and when he places his claims to your suffrages upon
that broad and ample basis, it must be GRANTed that he rests his
hopes upon some foundation; but, Gentlemen, the Candidate whom
I propose to you possesses such transcendent superiority in this
important feature that I feel BOAIed up with confidence, when I claim
for him your triumphant preference (cheers); and, Gentlemen, permit
me to add that, in the event of his return, which I now consider
certain (cheers), few orators in the hon: House will command more
attention, or be listened to with so much pleasure.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That the interests of the Wellington Cabinet were in
jeopardy is pictorially conveyed. “The Unsuccessful
Appeal” (September 25, 1830) shows John Bull arm-in-arm
with the king, while Wellington is pointing to a
distant movement amongst the crowd, and asking Mr.
Bull’s protection against his political foes. “My good old
friend, I want your assistance against these fellows, who
are about to unite for the purpose of overpowering me by
numbers.” The inimical confederates are Brougham and
Lords Holland, Durham, Grey, etc., on the one side, who
are fraternizing with Lord Eldon, the Duke of Cumberland,
and others, on the other. Johnny is thus responding to
the old campaigner’s appeal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I should be sorry to see you defeated by such an unholy alliance
after all the battles we have fought and won together; but the fact is,
I feel so oppressed with the glory of so many victories, that I must
beg to be excused from interfering any more for the present in the
disputes of others. There are, however, plenty of clever fellows to be
had, who are able and willing enough to assist you, but when you
again meet with such, let me advise you not to be too ready to quarrel
with them!”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">William IV. is quite at one with his friend, the last
speaker&mdash;“Whatever you say, John, I will agree to; for
<i>your</i> will is <i>my</i> pleasure.”</p>

<p>Before the new parliament assembled, the Cabinet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
received some damaging assaults from the press. The
nature of this concealed warfare is explained by HB in
his sketch of “A Masked Battery” (October 4, 1830). The
assailant is Henry Brougham: in his legal guise, entrenched
behind the “Result of the General Election,”
with the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for a screen, he is bespattering
his opponents, the beleaguered “Ins,” with ink. The Tory
Cabinet is suffering severely: Wellington is to the front,
trying to ward off the shower from Brougham’s inkstand-battery;
in his hand is a damaging attack on paper,&mdash;“The
Duke of Wellington and the Whigs.” Sir Robert
Peel is endeavouring to shelter himself behind his chief.
Lords Bathurst, Ellenborough, Lyndhurst, and Aberdeen
are all suffering from the assault.</p>

<p>When the House met, we get a prospect of the prime
minister reviewing his forces&mdash;“A Cabinet Picture”
(November 5, 1830). Wellington, with his colleagues,
Lords Aberdeen, Lyndhurst, Bathurst, Rosslyn, Melville,
and others, whom the chief is thus addressing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Having been obliged to recognize the King of the French, we
must, as a set-off&mdash;acknowledge our friend Miguel. The Belgians&mdash;poor
people!&mdash;not knowing how to take care of themselves, must be
protected from the evils of independence! So much for foreign affairs,
now for domestic. I say that our present system is the very perfection
of systems, and consequently admits of no improvement; I will go
further, and say that, while I have power, no species of reform shall
take place! and now&mdash;having said it&mdash;if Peel will but manage the
new Police, Hardinge Ireland, Goulburn [Chancellor of the Exchequer]
abstain from projects of finance, and Ellenborough hold his tongue,
we may manage to keep our seats for another session.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After the elections it was evident that things out-of-doors
were moving antagonistically to the interests of the
Wellington Cabinet, but the “Old Campaigner” still hoped
by stratagem to keep in power, although resolute in asserting
that while he kept office no species of reform should
take place. The premier’s optimist confidence “that his
ministry might keep their places for another session” is
shown to be misplaced, for the defeat of his ministry was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
clearly foreshadowed: “Guy Fawkes, or the Anniversary
of the Popish Plot” (November 9, 1830), shows that
destruction was abroad; and this cartoon is a late exemplification
of the old British institution of burning in
effigy a minister when out of favour. The political Guy is,
of course, Wellington, the hero of a hundred fights, reproduced
in straw, tied to a rickety chair, and is gaily borne
to the bonfire by a rejoicing mob of statesmen, his political
antagonists. Lord Lansdowne leads the way, with a blazing
torch to fire the fatal pyre; the bearers are the Duke of
Cumberland and Prince George (Duke of Cambridge), Lords
Holland, Sidmouth, Eldon, etc.; Aberdeen, Stanhope, and
the Duke of Newcastle bring up the rear in a high state of
exaltation;&mdash;these were the peers who “sapped the Tory
defences.”</p>

<p>Wellington was evidently losing popularity, and the
lustre he gained in the field was being clouded in the
Cabinet; John Bull has to come to his rescue against
the rabble, and the valiant captain is once more shown
sheltered under the king’s mantle. It appears the lord
mayor’s banquet was threatened with a hostile demonstration,
and the city magistrate, “Don Key,” was thrown
into a deadly state of apprehension by the alleged prospect
of being received with “cold indifference.” This cartoon
is entitled “The False Alarm; or, Much Ado about
Nothing.”</p>

<p>The Wellington tenure of power was doomed, and, like
C&aelig;sar’s, his fatal stab was to come from the hand of a
colleague, on the inopportune revival of the Eastern
Question. “Scene from the suppressed Tragedy, entitled
the Turco-Greek Conspiracy,” shows the minister (wearing
his well-earned laurels) done to death by the Peers at the
foot of Canning’s statue in the forum; the Senators being
armed with deadly speeches wherewith to accomplish this
tragic immolation. “Et tu Brute” are the hero’s closing
words addressed to his past comrade, Lord Londonderry,
who is giving the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<p>W. Heath, who was employed by McLean at the time
Doyle’s sketches were making their appearance, has given
many versions of events during George IV.’s somewhat
oppressive reign. At the close of 1830, with the advent
to the throne of a more constitutionally-minded sovereign,
the artist sums up the dismissal of a Cabinet whose actions
he had frequently criticized from a pictorially satirical
point of view. In the version of “His Honour the Beadle
Driving the Wagabonds Out of the Parish,” November 28,
1830, Heath has impressed Sir David Wilkie’s well-known
picture of “The Parish Beadle” into the service of parody.
King William IV., as the Bumble of the situation, is
making a clean sweep of the relics of the past reign:
“Come, be off: no hangers behind&mdash;out with you all!
I’ll let you see I represent the aristocracy of the parish!”
John Bull, who may be considered to have generally
endorsed his friend William’s policy with hearty goodwill,
is giving his approval: “That’s right, Master Beadle, do
your duty and clear the parish of the varments; they’ve
been a pest ever since they’ve been here.” The chancellor
Lyndhurst, Lord Ellenborough, Goulburn (late chancellor
of the exchequer), and the rest, are making a hasty retreat.
Peel, dragging his “new police” monkey attached to a
string, is hardly reconciled to his banishment from office:
“Vell, ve did all ve could to kick up a row afore ve vent!”
Wellington, as the “hurdy-gurdy” woman, dressed in the
faded splendours of an old soldier’s coat, is making all the
noise of which the instrument is capable while retreating
with his face to the foe.</p>

<p>The results of the general election of 1830 culminated
within a month of the reassembling of parliament in the
substitution of a Whig for a Tory ministry, and William
IV.’s tenure of the throne was inaugurated by the early
adoption of that liberal progress which developed into the
larger measure of reform within two years, the most
memorable act of his reign. Doyle shows the ensuing
distribution of offices, and sketches one of the intrigues for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
place&mdash;Henry Brougham, as “The Coquet,” being tempted
by Lord Grey to a political allegiance, and courted on the
woolsack with the bait of the chancellor’s wig. After
the preliminary skirmishing and cementing of necessary
alliances, the end was short, sharp, and decisive, and is
embodied by HB with his customary point and felicity, as
“Examples of the Laconic Style” (November 26, 1830).
The king is “standing at attention;” he has sent for Lord
Grey. “Your conditions?” The coming premier answers,
“Retrenchment, Reform, and Peace.” “Done!” says the
king, holding out his hand on the bargain. The Duke of
Wellington, on the left, is stepping off the scene, while
John Bull, to the right, is not reluctantly giving his late
commander the order, “Right about face, march!”</p>

<p class="caption">HIS HONOUR THE BEADLE (WILLIAM IV.) DRIVING THE WAGABONDS OUT OF THE PARISH. NOV. 28, 1830. By W. HEATH.</p>

<p class="author">
[<i>Page 354.</i></p>
</div>

<p>With the advent of the powerful Whig party came such
sweeping reforms that minds accustomed to the old order
of things began to take fright. It seemed that national
institutions, and those fabled landmarks, “The bulwarks
of the constitution,” bid fair to be swept away within six
months, and another appeal to the constituencies was
imminent. The Tory views of the new order of things were
embodied by Doyle (April 4, 1831) in “A Very Prophetical
and Pathetical Allegory,” in which it was foreshadowed
that the institutions of the country could not
survive reform, but must succumb within ten years. This
vision conjures up a deserted cemetery, wherein, in woeful
anticipation, is erected the tomb of departed greatness:
“Here lyeth the British Constitution, which, after a rapid
decline of ten years, departed this world, 1841.&mdash;I was
well; wishing to be better, here I am. <i>Sic transit gloria
mundi.</i>” The Duke of Wellington, as a widowed and
ancient crony in deep sables, is shedding a tear, and
depositing a wreath on the family vault, which is presumed
to contain such honoured dust.</p>

<p>The gloomy forebodings of the Tories are further
illustrated with much spirit in the guise of an expected
game of “Leap-Frog down Constitution Hill,” April 13,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
1831, in which the Whigs are flying over the heads of the
opposition. On Constitution Hill stand Burdett, O’Connell,
Hunt, and other advanced politicians, crying, “Go it, my
boys; we shall soon have it our own way;” the game is
proceeding swimmingly down the slope. Lord King has
brought down an archbishop&mdash;the head of the Church;
Lord Althorp is sweeping down the judges; Lord Lansdowne
has upset Lord Eldon; Lord Durham directs the tall
Duke of Cumberland to stoop his head; Lord Brougham, in
his chancellor’s robes, has alighted on the shoulders of the
Duke of Wellington; William IV. has “tucked in his head”
and “made a back” for Lord Grey; but the premier, in
his flying leap, has failed to clear the crown, which is sent
spinning. “D&mdash;n it,” says the king, “didn’t you tell me
you wouldn’t touch the Crown?”</p>

<p>The coming appeal to the country was preceded by the
usual political meetings; this circumstance is made the
subject of a felicitous parody, “<i>Anticipated</i> Radical Meeting”
(April 20, 1831). In one of Hunt’s Matchless (Blacking)
carts stands the glib-tongued Radical in the full tide of his
harangue; “Hunt, the Matchless Reformer,” is surrounded
by the Tory party; the opposition consists of the ex-ministers,
and includes Sugden, Peel, Horace Twiss,
Wetherell, Goulburn, Ellenborough, Wellington, Aberdeen,
and others, who are ironically welcoming and encouraging
the oration. Hunt’s speech is thus reported:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Will the Bill, I ask, do away with places and pensions? (Cheers.)
Will it abolish tithes and taxes? (Cheers.) In a word, will it make the
poor rich and happy? (Great cheering.) No! It will do none of these!
therefore I say this Bill is all a delusion! (Tremendous cheering and
waving of hats.)”</p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Old Eldon, mounted on the shoulders of his ally, the Duke
of Cumberland, is vociferously calling for “One cheer
more!”</p>

<p>The House dissolved on the 22nd of April, and the fresh
elections took place in May. The nature of John Bull’s complaint
and the respective views of the rival practitioners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
who were called in for consultation are set forth by HB
(May 2, 1831) as “Hoo-Loo-Choo&mdash;<i>alias</i> John Bull and
the Doctors.” The national prototype is seated in an arm-chair;
his huge corporation seems to have become utterly
unwieldy and inconvenient; he occupies the centre of the
picture. His doctors “in and out of place,” are on the
respective sides. John Bull is addressing Lord Grey:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I can’t say that my bodily health was ever better, or
that I ever felt stronger, tho’ to be sure I am not growing
younger; but then every one is telling me how deformed
I am grown of late, and this tumour&mdash;which I have had
from my infancy&mdash;is all a mass of Corruption.”</p>

<p>Grey, while indicating his colleagues, Althorp and
Russell, says in reply, “This deformity is quite inconsistent,
believe me, with the nature of your Constitution,
and therefore must be got rid of. I will undertake, with
your approbation, to remove it, and my assistant, Doctor
Russell here, will prepare you for the operation.”</p>

<p>Russell is observing, “I once thought that a case of
this description ought to be treated with great caution, and
even wrote, as well as talked, a great deal about it, but now
I am quite of a different opinion. I think there is nothing
like cutting away thro’ thick and thin!”</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel, one of the dismissed doctors, on mature
consideration, is inclined to question his past policy: “Yet
I begin to think we could have done better, when we found
him determined to think that his Constitution was impaired,
to have tried, just in the way of soothing, a gentle alternative
course.”</p>

<p>Dr. Wellington is still of his old opinion: “I say that
the man has no defect in his Constitution, and that what
they call Corruption is necessary to his existence; but now,
because he would not believe me, but chose rather to submit
to the experiments of those rash operators, Wharncliffe, who
is a sensible man, lays all the blame on me.”</p>

<p>The lively proceedings while the returns were preparing
were fittingly epitomized by HB as “May Day” (May 4,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
1831), setting forth as a “Jack-in-the-Green” performance
the new revels of the revisers of the constitution. The
king occupies the green, which is topped by a crown, and
bears the word “Reform;” the face of William IV. is
peeping through the aperture. Earl Grey is “My Lord;”
Sir Francis Burdett is almost equally conspicuous. Hobhouse,
Hume, and O’Connell are making a good deal of
rough music with shovels, and Russell has the Pandean
pipes and big drum, on which he is vigorously performing.
Lord Brougham, as “My Lady,” is going round with the
ladle; he is interrogated by the Duke of Cumberland and
Lord Eldon as to the “Man in the Green.” The Duke of
Gloucester and Lord Londonderry, among the audience,
are regarding “My Lady” with suspicion.</p>

<p>The second portion of the new tactics is developed as
“Leap-Frog on a Level; or, Going Headlong to the Devil”
(May 6, 1831). The turn of the Reformers has come, and
the Radicals are making them submit to the same process
as they lately inflicted on the Tories. Carlile is rolling
over a churchman to the place of torment, having leaped a
trifle too far; the Evil One, as he declares in person, “has
come to end your games.” “The Devil you are,” says the
author of the tracts. Sir Francis Burdett is unwillingly
giving a back, “Have I stooped for this?” His old ally,
“Porcupine” Cobbett, is leaping heavily on to the baronet’s
shoulders, “My turn now, old Glory.” Grey is staggering
while Hunt is “overing” him: “I begin to think this is a
very disorderly game.” The mob are shouting, “Go it,
Hunt,” which is displeasing to the now elevated orator:
“D&mdash;&mdash; the Rabble, they take me for one of themselves.”
Brougham is brought to his knees: “Hullo! you’ll have off
my wig;” O’Connell, firmly seated on the chancellor’s
back, is crying, “Oh! never mind; <i>I’ll</i> take care of that!”
The king is brought to the earth; “This is the levelling
system with a vengeance.” He is overturned by Hume, who
is exclaiming, “This summing-up is the <i>tottle</i> of the
whole.”</p>

<p>The House had dissolved on the 22nd of April, 1831, and
the elections which ensued were remarkable for spirit. A
quantity of literature, in the shape of broadsides, songs,
and squibs of a startling character, was produced on this
occasion, in such abundance that even for small constituencies
in out-of-the-way places these <i>jeux d’esprit</i> form
huge volumes. A number of parodies appeared on
the great question of the Reform Bill, imitations of
scripture among others. Of the ballads published over the
border, the one most descriptive of the constitutional
struggle is found in a parody of “Chevy Chase.”</p>

<p>This view of the situation is followed up by a cartoon
aimed at the opposition tactics, “Votaries at the Altar of
Discord” (April 20, 1831). Hunt is the high priest fanning
the incendiary flame at the Altar of Discord, before which
Sir Robert Peel, who seems to have relinquished power
reluctantly, as the mouthpiece of his kneeling followers,
is offering this invocation: “Powerful Goddess, deign to
hear our prayers; deserted in this, our great extremity, by
justice and wisdom, we fly to thee as a last refuge.” The
other devotees are Horace Twiss, Goulburn, Dawson, Sadler,
Sir E. Sugden, Sir C. Wetherell, Earl Carnarvon, and the
Dukes of Wellington and Newcastle. The opposition in
the Upper Chamber was in a highly excited state, an example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
of this is given in “Peerless Eloquence” (April 25,
1831). Lord Londonderry is boiling with indignation: “Is
it to be endured, I ask, that we should be called <i>things</i>&mdash;things
with Human pretensions? What was the fish-woman’s
virtuous indignation at being called ‘an individual’
to this? Nothing!” Brougham, on the woolsack,
remains calm under the torrent; Lords Aberdeen and
Wharncliffe, with the Duke of Wellington, are placidly
surveying the outraged senator.</p>

<p>The slaughter of the innocents is figuratively told (May,
1831) in a novel edition of the “Niobe Family.” Lord
Grey is the destroyer, his arrows are marked “Reform.”
The Niobe of this version is the Duke of Newcastle; the
smitten are Sir Charles Wetherell, Attwood, Sadler, and
others, whose constituencies were threatened with extinction
under the Reform Bill.</p>

<p>The motion for reform, then in full swing, is summed
up from a Tory standpoint (May 13, 1831); the legend
of “John Gilpin” is pressed into the service of the caricaturist.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Away went Gilpin, neck or naught,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Away went hat and wig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He little dream’d when he set out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of running such a rig.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">William IV. is, of course, the Gilpin of the situation; the
bottles slung to his side are ginger-beer ones&mdash;“Rotunda
Pop” and “Birmingham Froth;” the “Grey” horse is running
away with the king at a dashing pace, and the crown
is dislodged in the scuffle. John Bull, the pike-keeper,
has thrown open his gate, and is highly excited at the
sport: “Go it, my lads, never mind the turnpike!” Burdett
is enjoying the fun, but opines, “The Grey is evidently
running away with him.” Hume, Hunt, O’Connell, Cobbett,
and others are following on horseback in the king’s
wake. One cries, “Make way, make way; we’ve a great
stake depending on it.” The Irish Repealer is urging on
the pace, “Go along, never mind the geese and old women.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
The “geese” wear coronets, to symbolize the scared peers
scattered by the onslaught; and the “old apple woman”
capsized in the rush is old Eldon, the Tory ex-chancellor;
Croker is a “croaking” raven. The sign of the inn is
changed to a new version of the Crown up in the oak tree,
and the balcony is filled with the late ministers, travestied
as the ladies of the Gilpin party. Wellington is distressed
beyond measure at this alarming spectacle, and is appealing
to John Bull: “Good Mr. Gatekeeper, stop him; he
doesn’t know where he is going!” Sir Robert Peel
exclaims, “Oh, John Gilpin! John Gilpin! where are you
going? Don’t you know your old friends?” Goulburn
is declaring, “He must have lost his senses to ride at such
a rate!”</p>

<p class="caption">King (William IV.). <i>Loq.</i> “‘Reform <i>Bill</i>!’ Can that mean me?”</p>
</div>

<p>Another admirable version, the felicity of which has
been much appreciated, is entitled “The Handwriting on
the Wall” (May 26, 1831). The King, taking his constitutional
stroll in the Park, has come upon the inscription,
in huge white letters, painted on the wall, “Reform Bill!”
William IV., shading his eyes with his hand, is peering
at this legend,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> exclaiming “‘Reform <i>Bill</i>!’ Can that
mean me?”</p>

<p>The tendencies of the time were considered fraught with
danger; the measures of reform about to be experimentally
tested would, it was hinted, produce a political revolution&mdash;if
not a total subversion of everything; Lord Grey, the
Mephistopheles of the situation, as viewed through Doyle’s
“Conservative Magnifiers,” occupied an unenviable prominence,
and might expect a day of terrible retribution.
“Brissot’s Ghost” (May 30, 1831) is the only hint which
could be offered to the innovating statesman. The ghastly
figure of Brissot, with his decapitated head under his arm,
is disclosed to the premier as a startling vision, with a
significant warning, drawn from his fatal revolutionary
experience:&mdash;

<p>“Macbeth,” with the famous incantation scene, is

</div></div>
</div>

<p>There are five witches, wearing Republican red caps,
and armed with besoms of destructiveness, assembled
round the cauldron.</p>

<p>The three chief witches are Lords Grey, Durham
(“Yellow Lambton”), and Brougham. As the ingredients
are cast into the blaze, fed by Durham coal, Grey is singing
the charm:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">Double, double, toil and trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Lord Brougham takes up the invocation:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">“Freeman’s votes, and Grants by Charter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First-born rights in ev’ry quarter,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These the glorious spoils I bring.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Lord Durham has his allotted share:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Saving-Banks, the Funds, and Rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insurances and money lent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Throw them in, to make a quittance.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Round about the cauldron go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Constitution throw.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The king is unexpectedly surprising the incantation.
He is dumbfounded; the charm is already active, and away
flies his crown. He is girt with a scarf, “Repentance,” and
apostrophizes his reform friends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>“A <i>Tale</i> of a Tub&mdash;and the Moral of the <i>Tail</i>!”
(June 13, 1831) is another view of the critical juncture,
as it was then assumed to be. The old constitutional ship
is left for the whale-boat. The monster is in such dangerous
proximity that a dash from its tail&mdash;while splashing
“popular spray” over its would-be captors&mdash;threatens a
fatal catastrophe. Lord Althorp has thrown over a pretty
considerable tub, “Vested Interests and Chartered Rights;”
“There,” he is made to exclaim, “amiable monster!
In order to please you, we have thrown you all! Should
you require more, you must only take ourselves.” Lord
Grey is steering; Lords Brougham, Holland, and Durham
have the oars. The king, wearing his naval uniform, is
trying to keep the crown from falling overboard; he is
evidently apprehensive of the worst: “But why approach
so near the tail&mdash;the good-natured monster may, without
meaning any harm, upset us all in one of his gambols!”
The man at the helm is reassuring his chief: “My reasons
for steering are pretty plain, tho’ fortunately for me some
people don’t see them. It is by flattering the tail, that I
command the head!” Lord Brougham, “the schoolmaster
abroad,” is imparting this useful piece of knowledge: “It
has been discovered in the march of Intellect, that the <i>Tail</i>
often outstrips the <i>Head</i>!” Wellington and Peel have
stuck to the ship; the latter is still of opinion that he
ought to have made an effort to retain his post: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>“Yet

I can’t but think we might have succeeded in amusing it
for a long time with a very small <i>Keg</i>.” Wellington is
less confident: “I tell you, Bob, the Monster is not to be
satisfied!”</p>

<p>Other allusions of a seasonable character were also
produced by Doyle, apropos of the tendency of the epoch.
One of the best is selected among many, “Varnishing&mdash;a
Sign (of <i>the Times</i>)” (June 1, 1831). The sign of the
King’s Head is undergoing renovation; Lord Brougham,
in his chancellor’s robes, is mounted on a ladder, and
employed in touching up the royal countenance with a pot
of varnish. “I think that, considering I was not bred to
the trade, I am not a bad hand at bedaubing a King. After
all, to produce effect, I find there is nothing like plenty of
varnish.” Lord Grey, from an open window, is surveying
with marked satisfaction his colleague’s work. “Canning
used to talk about a Red Lion; but I say that, in our
reforming times, there is no such sign for a (re) publican
as a King’s Head, although a Star and Garter is not to be
despised!”</p>

<p>The somewhat well-worn subject of the hustings is also
treated pictorially amongst the cartoons which appeared
during the elections. One version is entitled, “The <i>Rival</i>
Mount-O’-<i>Bankes</i>; or, the Dorsetshire Juggler” (May 25,
1831). The scene of the hustings is again travestied as a
fair. “Bankes and Co.’s Old-Established Booth” is left
quite deserted; a pillar of the Church is the solitary patron.
“If our friends don’t come up faster, we may shut up shop,”
says the showman; while his assistant is declaring, in
allusion to the success of the rival show, “This Juggler
is juggling all our customers away from us!” The
“Nonpareil Juggler” has, in fact, monopolized all the
custom. Lord Grey is the showman; he is holding forth
his programme to the numerous patrons: “The Bill, the
whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill of the Performance of
the Nonpareil Calcraft.” The showman, “Grey, Licensed
Dealer in Curiosities,” is pointing to a glowing picture of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the entertainment to be seen within&mdash;Calcraft, in the very
act of swallowing a lengthy speech dead against the
principles of the reform party as represented by Lord
Grey; he is described as “Lately exhibited in the metropolis
by Monsieur Villainton, with unheard-of success.”
The customers are thus exhorted:&mdash;</p>

and another, “I like novelty, so here goes.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Doyle has given a clever embodiment of a current political
situation, borrowed from the illustrious humourist,
his predecessor: “LINEal Descent of the Crown.” See
Hogarth’s works, “Four Prints of an Election” (June 23,
1832). A modernized version of the sign of the “Crown”
is dependent from a beam; Lord Grey, with his face to the
building, is seated upon that portion of the support which
he is hacking lustily with a sickle, marked “Bill.” Cobbett,
Hume, and O’Connell are tugging away at the rope
which is to accomplish the downfall. The former exclaims,
“If we act in union, we’ll soon bring it to our own level.”
Hunt remarks, “I fear his exalted seat will turn his head.”
O’Connell is encouraging the dangerous exertions of the
Reform chief: “Ply the Bill well there, Grey, and it will
soon be all down.”</p>

<p>A reference to the possible effects of changed politics
upon the suffrages of constituencies is slyly conveyed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
HB’s sketch of “The Cast-off Cloak.” Sir John Hobhouse
is standing at the entrance of the War Office; he
has removed the red-lined cloak of “Radicalism,” which
he is thrusting on his old colleague, Sir Francis Burdett:
“Pray relieve me of this, Burdett. I shall find it a great
incumbrance in a <i>warm</i> place like this.” The reply of the
veteran Sir Francis is more politic: “Ay, but don’t forget
that you have an engagement in Covent Garden.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> You
may find the atmosphere rather <i>cool</i> in that quarter.”
Burdett’s own political convictions were to undergo as
sudden a transmutation, as HB has illustrated a few years
later.</p>

<p>As it was felt by the Conservative party that the king,
by whose instrumentality the important measure of reform
was alone carried, was bound on an enterprise of which the
results were doubtful, and, according to their apprehensions,
desperate, they tenaciously fought for the inviolability of
corruption.</p>

<p>According to Doyle’s new version of “Mazeppa”
(August 7, 1832), the king is bound and tied to “Reform,”
represented as “the wild horse of the steppes,” surrounded
by wolves, some of whom bear Tory visages, among which
the face of the Duke of Wellington is easily identified.
Horse and rider are overleaping the barrier of “Vested
Interests,” while beneath the courser rushes the “Revolutionary
Torrent,” whose volume is increasing. The
success of this spirited version induced the designer to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
publish a second plate (September 25th), presenting the
sequel. It is evident in this&mdash;which exhibits the wild
horse, and Mazeppa, his rider, extended on the plains, but
apparently uninjured&mdash;that the threatening vortex of the
“Revolutionary Torrent” has been passed, and neither
has been swamped; but the king is landed in the midst
of the herd of wild steeds, weirdly careering round the
prostrate pair are the rest of the tribe, on whose heads
appear the faces of the leading advocates of reform&mdash;Lord
Brougham, Lord Grey, Duke of Richmond, Lord John
Russell, Lord Althorp, Sir James Graham, etc.</p>

<p>The new parliament only sat from June 14, 1831, to
December 3, 1832. Towards the close of the session
(November 22, 1832) it was hinted that ministers were
not altogether too happy, and they had flown to stimulants
to promote a fictitious confidence. “Ministers and
(in) their Cups!” is the title; each has a presentation
gold cup in his hand, and a punch-bowl is in the centre of
the table. The Ministers are half-seas-over; Grey is singing
“Here’s Comfort when we Fret;” Russell is joining in
the chorus. Althorp declares, “I am quite overpowered;”
and Brougham, who has further been presented with a gold
toddy-ladle, is crying, “Ah, this is now the greatest consolation
we have left. I wish some one would give poor
Palmy a cup!”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="medium">CHARACTERISTICS OF ELECTIONEERING, 1833 TO 1857.</span></h2>

<p class="noindent">John Doyle, as a Tory satirist, was eagerly anticipating
indications of change in the popular sentiments. His
warnings on the Reform Bill had fallen unheeded, and
the Whig party was still strong in power. HB ventured
on the hint that the Tories were only temporarily in disfavour,
and that they had but to adapt themselves to the
times and resume office. The “Waits” (January, 1833)
gives an ingenious and novel view of political matters. John
Bull, in dressing-gown and double night-cap, is leaning
out of his first-floor window in critical contemplation of the
minstrels’ efforts to please his ear. The Duke of Wellington,
with the smallest of fiddles, has the leadership of “the
waits.” Lord Ellenborough (trombone), Sir Robert Peel
(flute), and Lord Aberdeen (’cello) are the midnight harmonists.
The awakened householder, Mr. Bull, is requesting
a more piquant programme: “I’m tired of your
eternal ‘God save the King’ and ‘Rule Britannia,’&mdash;give
us something French&mdash;‘The Marseillaise’ or ‘The Parisienne.’”
Wellington, touching his hat, replies, “Please
your Honour, we don’t play them ’ere tunes.”</p>

<p>“Sindbad the <i>Sailor</i> and the Old Man of the Sea!”
(<i>vide</i> fifth voyage, June 8, 1833) was published after the
dissolution. William IV. is, of course, the marvellous
traveller, and the incubus he has submitted to get settled
on his shoulders is the reforming premier, Lord Grey.</p>

<p>That parliamentary reform, though commenced, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
by the extreme party considered but an imperfect measure,
is pictorially illustrated in various designs by HB; for
instance, the elusive “Time” is shown running away with
the great Whig Reform Bill, and Lord Althorp is seen
tearing after the vanishing roll, crying, “Stop thief!”
He has the <i>Times</i> in his pocket, presumably the organ by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
which John Bull’s course was piloted, and is vainly trying
to come up with the departing thief and his measure, one
tiny corner Lord Althorp has torn off, “Schedule A,” and
that promises to be all he can save from the abduction.</p>

</div>

<p>Another version, also by Doyle, embodies in graphic
form the views of the root-and-branch reformers; a grand
trio of Sir Francis Burdett, then a prominent Radical;
Joseph Hume, who was all for economic reform, in which
important branch he has left no true successor; and Daniel
O’Connell, a most important factor in his time, whose
covert designs were nothing less than “Repeal.” These
gentlemen, who were among the most conspicuous politicians
of their day, are linked arm-in-arm as the “Three Great
Pillars of Government; or, A Walk from White Conduit
House to St. Stephen’s” (July 23, 1834); published under
the same auspices of Thomas McLean, at the Haymarket
Gallery, as the other examples of Doyle’s satirical ability
reproduced in this summary. Sir Francis Burdett is with
much spirit advocating “Equal Representation and Annual
Parliaments&mdash;and <i>that</i> (a snap of the fingers) for the
Borough-mongers.” Hume is applauding this resolute
front: “Bravo! and Cheap Government;” to which
Daniel O’Connell is adding, “And Universal Suffrage, and
Vote by <span class="smcap">Ballot</span>, eh?” with, as a supplement, in a very
small whisper, “A Repeal of the Union.”</p>

<p>When another general election occurred, the situation
of honest John Bull was figured as that of a stout gentleman
wishing to be carried on his road, but distracted as to the
conveyance he must choose. The Tory ’bus stands contrasted
with the new reform steam vehicle, which is
crowded with experimentalists. “The Opposition ‘Busses”
is the title of this version, also due to HB. The Duke of
Wellington is trying to secure John Bull for his old coach,
which does not seem much patronized.</p>

<p class="caption">DESIGN FOR THE KING’S ARMS, TO BE PLACED OVER THE NEW
SPEAKER’S CHAIR. FEB. 17, 1835. BY J. DOYLE (HB).</p>
</div>

<p>With the renovated and redressed Constitution, the wits
hinted that novel accessories would be in request, and that
the insignia of regality would also have to be revised.
Such a suggestion is offered in Doyle’s “Original Design
for the King’s Arms, to be placed over the <i>New</i> Speaker’s
Chair,” where old Cobbett, late “Peter Porcupine,” the
persistent agitator, who obtained a seat in Parliament after
the passing of the Reform Bill, is playfully substituted as
the British Lion; and the high-bred Sir Francis Burdett,
who, as is seen in these electioneering illustrations, had so
long figured before the public as a Radical reformer, and
was now beginning to turn to the Tory interest, is usurping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
the position in the royal escutcheon generally appropriated
to the fabled unicorn.</p>

<p>The advent of the ballot was not ardently desired by
the Tories, and it was hinted that the consequences of its
introduction would entail such inconveniences as are figured
in the two illustrations here given, rather implying that
violence and coercion would henceforth be unavailing, and
that, as bribery would be in vain also, administrative
corruptors would prefer to make a more legitimate use of
their money.</p>

<p>A ballad of the “broadside” order appeared upon “The
Windsor Election” of 1835. As a genuine rough-and-ready
production, called forth by the circumstances of the contest,
and embodying the names of the candidates, it is worth
preserving as typical of thousands of similar ballads, which
have in all probability perished from the bills of mortality.</p>

<p>Two years later, another appeal to the country was
impending. At the beginning of 1837, HB produced a
figurative prospect of the situation, as “A New Instance
of the Mute&mdash;ability of Human Affairs.” The British
Constitution, that fabled “admiration of surrounding
nations,” and “monument of the collective wisdom of
generations,” is at last moribund: the fatal hour has
arrived, and the chamber of mourning is presented to view.
Mounted upon sable trestles, and covered with a rich pall,
is the coffin which contains the defunct, according to the
plate, “Died 1837, of the prevailing Influenza, the British
Constitution of 1688, aged 149 years;” the mutes, with
trappings of woe, stationed on either side of the coffin, are
Lord John Russell and Spring Rice.</p>

<p>In March, 1837, HB gave the public a version of that
appeal to the constituencies, then becoming more imminent:
“Going to the Fair with It. A cant phrase for doing anything
in an extravagant way&mdash;known, it is presumed,
to most persons.” The three performers are in the thick
of the fair, within the circle of booths; one tent has the
sign of the “King’s Head,” with the Union Jack flying,
another mounts the sign of “The Mitre.” Dan O’Connell
is seated on the ground as a conjuror, with a paraphernalia
of swords, rings, and balls&mdash;“Irish titles and appropriation
clause” among the former. He is performing the “great
sword-swallowing trick,” with a blade marked “Repeal.”
Spring Rice, dressed as a tumbler, is balancing a block on a
stick which rests on his chin. The chief attraction, the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
performance which is absorbing the wonder of the entire
spectators, is that of the acrobat, Lord John Russell, who
is sustaining himself in the air raised on a single support,
marked, “Irish Corporation Bill.” John Bull, who
occupies the central position, cannot disguise his interest
in the feat: “Well done, little ’un; you’ve got up a surprising
height&mdash;take care how you let yourself down.” The
Duke of Wellington is counselling John Bull: “These
tricks are decidedly dangerous, and should not be encouraged.”
Sir Robert Peel and Lord Stanley are in
conference, as retired professors of conjuring. “This is the
great trick now&mdash;the stilts are quite discarded.” A bishop
is observing, “That man balances very inequitably.”</p>

<p>On the other side are grouped various critics of the
performance. Lord Ebrington considers the trick “wonderful,
even more astonishing than the Stilts.” Sir William
Molesworth declares, “They deserve encouragement, but
they don’t go half as far as they ought.” Hume also
thinks, “it is very well as far as it goes!” Lord Brougham,
wearing his distinguishing plaid trousers, is in conference
with Mr. Roebuck as to starting an opposition show: “What
do you think if we were to set up a little concern of our
own: you would make a very nice little Tumbler, and I&mdash;you
know, am an old hand that way!” Sir Francis
Burdett, who had given some surprising performances in
his time, is leaving the fair, declaring, “I can’t stand it
any longer;” while his associate, Sir J. C. Hobhouse,
advises him to wait a while, “Don’t go yet; the best of
the sport is to come!”</p>

<p>The struggles, twists, and contortions of ministers to
keep in place, and the involutions of “Ins and Outs,” were
ably parodied, a few months before the dissolution, as the
“Fancy Ball&mdash;Jim Crow Dance and Chorus” (April 17,
1837); in which the most prominent movers of both parties
are travestied in fancy costumes, out-at-elbows, and with
blackened faces&mdash;the likenesses admirably preserved; and
executing a reel worthy of “Chimney Sweeps’ Day;” the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
whole arranged to the then-popular air of “Jump Jim
Crow,” introduced at that time by an actor named
Rice&mdash;the forerunner of the “Christy Minstrels” of a
later generation. The central figures are&mdash;O’Connell,
who is making a contemptuous gesture, and his partner,
Lord Melbourne; Wellington and Peel are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>;
Stanley and Graham are jigging gaily together, so are
Lords Abinger and Lyndhurst; Sir Francis Burdett and
General de Lacy Evans are figuring back-to-back in approved
Irish-jig style; and Spring Rice is getting on well
to a lively measure along with Lord John Russell.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sir Francis Burdett&mdash;the “seven-stringed Jack” and
admirer of the French revolution of Gillray’s cartoons,
the fiery Radical of Cruikshank’s early flashing squibs&mdash;after
a career of remarkable prominence as a zealous
innovator and friend of reform, quixotically riding full
tilt against abuses of all kinds, was exhibiting himself, in
the session about to close his old career, as a convert to
fine full-bodied Tory principles. HB has pictorially
given the contests the famous baronet had waged with
the mighty Dan O’Connell, whose “repealing” proclivities
seem finally to have opened Burdett’s eyes as to the
desirability of preserving the integrity of the kingdom.
His highly characteristic speech at the Westminster
hustings is the best exposition of his changed opinions.
In his picture of “A Fine Old English Gentleman, One of
the Olden Time” (May 10, 1837), Doyle has commemorated
the baronet’s final accession to the country party, by
drawing Sir Francis in his familiar guise&mdash;blue coat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
tightly buttoned, with swallow tails, white vest and ample
white cravat, white cords, and top-boots,&mdash;seated, a prisoner
in his own apartments, suffering from an attack of gout.
A picture of the Tower, hung on the wall, indicates a
previous episode of imprisonment, when Burdett became
an inmate of that edifice (April 6, 1810); he was the last
political prisoner confined there. It was felt that the
baronet’s connection with Westminster was about to be
severed; however, he offered himself for re-election, that
his old constituents might pronounce upon his action.</p>

<p>The candidature of Mr. Leader formed the subject of
several of Doyle’s suggestive sketches. In “Following the
Leader” (May 12, 1837), HB has given a fanciful version
of the candidate’s supporters impressed as boardsmen.
O’Connell heads the file, with a placard “Leader for
Westminster.” Lord Melbourne is advertising “Leader
and Reform of the House of Lords.” Lord John Russell,
as a “sandwich” man, announces “Annual Parliaments,
Universal Suffrage, and Vote by Ballot;” Lord Palmerston’s
board declares, “I am a Tory, and was always a
Tory.” Sir William Molesworth, Hume, and others bring
up the rear, with “Leader for Westminster” placards.
The Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel are surveying
the demonstration from a distance, “These, I suppose, are
some of the Pismires!”</p>

<p>“May Day in 1837” is another ingenious version of
the political situation. The figure enclosed in the green,
which is surmounted by the crown, is the king, William IV.;
he is getting nervous at his situation: “I have got into a
warm berth, it must be owned; indeed, it grows rather
Hellish.” Melbourne makes a handsome “my lord,” and
Russell’s figure just suits “my lady.” Lord Morpeth is a
serviceable clown. The whole dance is performed to the
drum accompaniment of Dan O’Connell. Spring Rice, as
chancellor of the exchequer, is going round to John Bull
for the supplies, much to the national prototype’s surprise:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>“You little spooney! How came you to be entrusted with

the ladle, eh?” Sir Francis Burdett, still in his sweep’s
disguise, is stalking off from the concern: “These ’ere
fellers grow so werry wulgar that a gentlemen can’t keep
company with them no longer.”</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that Sir Francis Burdett,&mdash;finally
forsaking those Radical principles upon which he
had been returned in the first instance for Westminster
in 1807&mdash;for which important city he had sat until 1837,&mdash;appealed
to the constituency which had elected him for
thirty years, and, with that chivalrous spirit which distinguished
his nature, challenged the votes of his supporters
as to how far his changed politics might enlist their
approval, and invited his friends to pronounce their verdict
on his conduct. Upon the baronet’s appeal to his constituents,
in the character of “a fine old English gentleman,
all on the Tory side,” when, in May, 1837, he resigned
his membership for Westminster as a Radical, and offered
himself as a Tory candidate, he was opposed by John
Temple Leader, a prominent Radical politician. Party
feeling was considerably intensified, and ungenerous efforts
were made by his late Radical colleagues to inflict the
mortification of a defeat upon the reformed baronet. The
famous agitator, Daniel O’Connell, whose collision with
Burdett was among the chief causes of his changed
opinions, exerted himself to the utmost to bring about
the discomfiture of his opponent, who, in return, dealt
scathing contempt upon the arch-agitator. Many political
satires and squibs were produced on this occasion, and, in
a literary and artistic point of view, one feature of great
interest associated with this incident was the appearance
of an electioneering caricature by the author of “Vanity
Fair.” The Marquis of Wharton, Swift, Burns, Sir Hanbury
Williams, Canning, Moore, and many eminent poets,
writers, and statesmen have originated electioneering
ballads, and Thackeray has associated his name with a
pictorial squib; in 1837, he was, as part-proprietor and
contributor, associated with the unfortunate venture (as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
regards the inroad its subsequent failure made on his
fortune), the <i>Constitutional and Public Ledger</i>&mdash;a daily
journal, of ultra-liberal views; and as its programme
included extension of popular franchise, vote by ballot,
equal civil rights, religious liberty, and short parliaments,
it may be imagined that the political creed which he at
that time professed inclined Thackeray to look with disfavour
upon the converted Burdett as an apostate from his
faith: he has expressed this view in a political satire
addressed to the electors of Westminster. The picture,
a quarto leaf, was presented with the <i>Guide</i> (May 13,
1837). It represents Sir Francis Burdett and his opponent,
Leader, on the hustings, as “The Rivals; or, Old Tory
Glory and Young Liberal Glory.” Sir Francis is represented
as decrepit, and a martyr to the gout&mdash;another
attribute of a “fine old English gentleman”&mdash;from which
the baronet suffered much in later life; his foot is swathed
in flannel, and crutches support him to stand; his coat is
worn inside out, and a glory round his head alludes to an
expression of “pismire voters” he had applied to the
following of his antagonists. Beneath the picture is a
further explanation of the satirist’s meaning:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Historical truth has compelled the artist to portray the physical
infirmities which keep Sir Francis from all duties except that of dining
at the Pavilion; but our readers will recollect that that infirmity is
the gout&mdash;one which mankind seem, by common consent, to have
determined never to regard with compassion.... A picture of the
Tower is seen in the background; and Sir Francis, with a ‘glory’
of ‘pismires’ round his head, is depicted as hobbling away in his
turned coat from the recollections, as from the principles, of his
youth.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of his sudden conversion, the electors of Westminster
held their respected member in too much veneration
to inflict upon him the ignominy of rejection; the wielder
of the “Herculean club,” depicted as the foremost leader
among the “plebs” by George Cruikshank, who has
described the object of his shafts as “the eloquent and
noble Sir Francis Burdett,” was placed at the head of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
poll by a majority of five hundred votes over his antagonist,
Leader, who had come forward as the Radical champion
to oppose his return. Sir Francis Burdett is so prominent
a personage in the annals of electioneering, as well as in
those of parliamentary history, that a specimen of his
eloquence may not be out of place; especially as the speech
which he made to his constituents after the declaration of
the poll by the high bailiff of Westminster is an admirable
example of the orations which may be considered appropriate
to these memorable occasions on the part of the
successful candidate. Sir Francis rested his firm attitude
on his antipathy to see the British empire <i>dismembered</i>:
history repeats itself, and it was on the question of “Repeal
of the Union” that he broke with his party.</p>

<h3>“SPEECH OF SIR FRANCIS BURDETT ON HIS FINAL
RETURN FOR WESTMINSTER, 1837.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen, Electors of the City and Liberties of Westminster</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>“It now becomes my pleasing task to return you my most
sincere and grateful thanks for the high honour which you have again
conferred upon me. In the first place, I have to thank you for the
arrangements that you have made, and for the consideration you have
manifested in regard to the present state of my health, and for the relief
your attention has afforded me from those duties which would have been
painful and difficult on this great and important occasion, and which has
rendered my part in the struggle comparatively easy and full of satisfaction.
(Cheers.) Permit me to congratulate you upon the noble, the
patriotic, the independent efforts you have made, and through you,
gentlemen, to congratulate the people at large upon the glorious
triumph of the English constitution, which has been achieved against
the vain and futile efforts of Radicalism and democracy. Gentlemen,
I congratulate you upon the firm determination you have shown to
maintain all the great and inestimable institutions of this country
against the efforts of her enemies. (Loud cheers, with faint hisses.)
The task which I have now to perform is both short and pleasant, and
I shall not now detain you, after the triumph you have achieved and
the victory you have won, merely to indulge my own feelings of
exultation and of gratification; but this I will say, that the electors
of Westminster have by the result of their noble and patriotic exertions
set an example to the people of England, to be looked up to and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
followed; and in every part of this great nation I make no doubt but
that this brilliant example will have the happy effect of sending good
men, who love their country and venerate her constitution, to unite
for their defence, and at the same time to defeat the machinations and
conspiracies of the bad. (Loud applause.) I will not dwell on these
subjects, but this much I will observe, that you are much indebted
even to your enemies for the signal triumph you have so nobly and so
gloriously achieved. (Great cheering.) The malignity and malice of
some persons have done much to aid the cause of the constitution;
but I should say that if there is one individual to whom you are more
indebted than any other, that person certainly was Mr. Daniel
O’Connell. (Loud cheers and groans.) The attacks of that individual
have tended to serve the cause which they were designed to injure.
Gentlemen, the big beggarman of Ireland (renewed cheers) has mistaken
the good sense and patriotism of the people of England. He
has intruded himself with his uncalled-for advice upon the electors of
Westminster, and with (as it now turns out) his disregarded threats.
He has intruded that advice and those suggestions in an Irish letter,
couched in a strain more Irish than Irish itself (loud laughter), and
containing in every point that mixture of blarney and bully, the former
of which has only excited the disgust, and the latter the contempt of
the electors of Westminster. (Loud cheers, groans, and laughter.) I
know not what influence that letter may be said to have had upon His
Majesty’s ministers; but this I know, that the people of England, and
especially the electors of Westminster, were made of sterner stuff.
Whatever His Majesty’s ministers may think proper to do, what course
they may choose to pursue, we have shown our determination to
maintain and support the English constitution and to resist to the
uttermost the dismemberment of the British empire, notwithstanding
that Mr. Daniel O’Connell is our declared and determined foe. (Loud
cheers, with shouts of disapprobation from the ‘Leader’ party.) In
addition, I will merely say that you view as I do the attempt to control
your opinions lately made by the great popish priest-ridden paid
patriot of Ireland. (Great applause and sensation.) And I will add this,
that I wish such persons would declare and destroy themselves as he
has done; no danger could then be apprehended, as I think it would
be on all occasions safer to have such persons my foes than my friends.
(Cheers, and yellings from the ‘Leader’ party.) Gentlemen, with these
observations I shall take my leave. The sun shines upon our principles
and our affections at this moment; but there is a still brighter sunshine
in every honest English heart at the triumph achieved by you
and the example you have set to the rest of England. (Cheers.)
Wishing you all good and happiness, and full of the devotion I owe
you electors of Westminster and to the friends to the cause of England
and the constitution, I now take my leave. (Renewed cheering, which
continued for several minutes, during which time the hon. baronet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
bowed to the meeting and retired from the hustings, accompanied as
he came, by a large body of his friends and supporters.)”</p></blockquote>

<p>The situation of Mr. Leader was illustrated by a parody
of Sir E. Landseer’s picture of “The Dog and the Shadow;”
the bone is Bridgwater (which seat he relinquished to
contest Westminster)&mdash;the latter is inscribed on the shadow.</p>

<p>The sequel of the Westminster contest was given by
HB as a “Race for the Westminster Stakes between an
Old Thoro’bred and a Young Cock-tail&mdash;weight for age&mdash;the
old ’un winning in a canter” (May 22, 1837). Lord
Russell, Wellington, and others are assembled as spectators
in a booth to the right. Lord Castlereagh, the jockey,
is bringing in easily the high-mettled racer with Burdett’s
face. Roebuck is vainly whipping and spurring “Leader,”
the second horse. Hume and O’Connell are highly excited
at the defeat of their favourite.</p>

<p>The question of a Repeal of the Union was one of a
momentous order, and accordingly a considerable interest
seems to have attended Burdett’s change of sides. Doyle
has given a capital version of the story in “Taking up a
Fare. ‘All the World’s a Stage’” (May 24, 1837). The
coach represented is “Peel’s Stager;” Sir James Graham
is ostler; Sir Robert Peel, as “whip,” is raising up his reins
and addressing the box passenger, William IV., “We
begin to load up capital well,” alluding to Burdett, the
fresh customer. “You don’t say so,” remarks the king.
Peel continues his reminiscences of the new inside passenger.
“He as is now getting in&mdash;was formerly a great ally of the
‘Comet.’<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> He has since travelled occasionally with the
‘Mazeppa’<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> people; but, for some time back, I have
missed him off the road entirely.” The Duke of Wellington,
who is making everything secure, and Lord Lyndhurst
are in the “boot.” Sir Francis Burdett, still lamed with
the gout, is about to enter the coach; the door is held for
him by Lord Stanley: “I should know your face: didn’t you
once drive the ‘Darby Dilly?’ What are you doing now?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
Lord Stanley (whom HB, in a former cartoon, had drawn
upsetting the “Darby Dilly” in question) is touching his
hat to Sir Francis, and replying, “At present, Sir, I’m
with these people; but since ‘the Dilly’ was done up I
haven’t had no regular engagement. I sometimes drives
the ‘Conservative’ up a stage and sometimes take it
down.” Lord Castlereagh appears as Burdett’s tiger.</p>

<p>Burdett, the ex-Radical champion, still in his congenial
character of “Don Quixote,” is next shown attacking the
“Lion of Democracy.” The picture of this adventure is
entitled “The Last and Highest Point at which the Unheard-of
Courage of Don Quixote ever did, or could arrive, with
the Happy Conclusion.” “An Old Song to a New Tune”
(June 17, 1837), shows the Whig wherry reduced to make
great exertions to keep ahead; of the six rowers, the faces
of Palmerston, Duncannon, and Melbourne are alone
shown; Lord John Russell is steering. The passengers are
John Bull, with an uneasy expression, seated beside the
king, who is evidently upset by the motion, and looks very
unwell. The parody runs&mdash;</p>

<p>Leader’s fate over the Westminster contest (June 17,
1837) is summed up as “A Dead Horse&mdash;a Sorry Subject,&mdash;what
was once a Leader in the Bridgwater Coach;
supposed to have been driven to Death by his Cruel Masters.”
Hume is driving off the defeated in a knacker’s cart.</p>

<p>“We, the People of England” (July 1837), exhibits
Messrs. Hume, Roebuck, and Wakley as the “Three Tailors
of Tooley Street,” all three sitting cross-legged; the former,
slate in hand, is working out one of his grand historic
“tottles.”</p>

<p>The candidature of General Evans for Westminster is
summed up as “Reorganizing the Legion” (24 July, 1837).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
The boardmen all appear in ragged regimentals, as the
remnant of the Spanish Legion, and a very woebegone set
they seem; the fugleman, wearing a cocked hat, has a
pictorial placard of a leader taking to flight, with the
legend, “I run;” the posters appear chiefly designed to
canvass “Murray for Westminster;” and General Evans
is himself trying to make the file straight with his malacca
cane, while crying, “Eyes right.”</p>

<p>Sir Francis Burdett had, in his altered politics, fought,
conquered, and made his final bow at the hustings of
Westminster, he being at the time in indifferent health;
his return for Wiltshire was the next point of interest.
How far this change of constituency suited the baronet’s
own constitution is displayed by HB, who had previously
exhibited the subject of his sportive humour under his
gouty infirmity. “Grinding Young” (July 25, 1837) is
the title of a new application of an old fancy; Burdett,
broken by age and debility, with his foot swathed in flannel,
showing the gouty foe triumphant, is hobbling with a
crutch up the ladder which leads from “Westminster” to
the wonderful mill; and, presto! an agriculturist turns
the handle, and forth from the hopper emerges the baronet
in his familiar guise, spick, span, and spruce, with the
elastic smartness and activity of youth, he is stepping out
into “North Wilts.”</p>

<p>An ingenious election skit appeared on Lord Durham’s
appeal to the local constituency: it is entitled, “The
Newest Universal Medicine” (July 27, 1837). Lord Durham
appears as a compounder of quack nostrums; he wears an
apron, and is standing at a counter, stirring with a pestle
a mortar containing his novel mixture. Beneath it is his
“Letter to the Electors of Durham,” and around are the
varied ingredients of his “Universal Panacea”&mdash;such as
“Conservative Opiate,” “Radical Alcohol,” with “Whig
Alkali;” while all sorts of colours are ready to hand,
indigo, and orange, light blue, mustard (Durham), and verdigris.
While mixing his pills, Lord Durham is exclaiming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
“Now to extinguish that Quack Morison!” A large box
stands ready for the medicament, addressed to “Daniel
O’Connell, Esq., M.P., General Association and Trades-Union,
Dublin;” a smaller box is directed to the Bishop of Exeter.
On a chair stands a small collection of the quack compounds
and remedies in boxes of various hues, and addressed to
the <i>Times</i>, <i>Standard</i>, <i>Globe</i>, and <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, indicative
of Lord Durham’s versatile talents and scribbling
propensities.</p>

<p>A touching allegory for a rejected candidate was
furnished by HB over these same elections. “As You
like It” (July 31, 1837). The wounded and solitary deer
which has come down to the brook, presents the lachrymose
countenance of Roebuck; the shaft which has caused his
tears is marked “Bath.” Lord John Russell, as the
“Melancholy Jacques,” is, from the other side of the water,
soliloquizing over the Roebuck’s fate.</p>

<p>Dr. Bowring is favoured with a place in Doyle’s portrait-gallery,
as “The Rejected of Kilmarnock” (August 21,
1837).</p>

<p>Another defeat at the general election forms food for
HB’s playful irony. This time it is Joseph Hume rejected
by Middlesex: “Figurative Representation of the Late Catastrophe”
(August 31, 1837). The Middlesex balloon is
sailing majestically out of reach; the gentleman thrown
out is descending at a fine pace; Joseph Hume’s parachute
is blown inside out, and he is ejaculating in his fall, “Now,
unless some friendly dunghill receives me, I am lost for
ever.” Below him are the green plains of Erin, and the
spot on which the discomfited aeronaut is descending is
shown to be Kilkenny.</p>

<p>Daniel O’Connell pretty generally seems the master of
the situation in the impressions we get of the big Liberator
in Doyle’s admirable and genially humorous cartoons. In
another aspect of the 1837 election, published at the same
date, the great Dan is installed as passenger and traffic
manager at the metropolitan head-quarters of the new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
railway. “Great Western General Booking Office” (August
31st) shows those gentlemen who have been so unfortunate
as to miss their seats besieging O’Connell for fresh places,
“Gentlemen,” he cries, with good-natured desire to assist
all, “we are all full; but, if you will only wait for the next
train, we shall, I have no doubt, be able to accommodate
you all with seats.” The best-known of the rejected ones
are clamouring round the counter: “I am afraid we are
thrown out for the present,” says one; while Dr. Bowring
“the rejected of Kilmarnock,” is of opinion, “It seems
there is a screw loose somewhere in their principal engine.”
Roebuck stands first of the unfortunates; his slight luggage
is “at the end of his stick;” Hume, carpet-bag in hand,
has secured a ticket, and is departing&mdash;evidently with grave
misgivings&mdash;to Kilkenny. Emerson Tennent and Sir James
Graham are standing at the door of the office.</p>

<p>The ultimate reception of Hume by Kilkenny is set
forth by the same hand: “Shooting Rubbish” (August 31,
1837). Dan O’Connell, habited as an Irish peasant, has
brought Hume on a hay-trolley to a thatched cabin marked
“Kilkenny;” he is gently lowered on to a heap by the wayside,
where, according to a notice-board, “Rubbish may be
shot.” “I think,” says Dan, “that is letting you down
nice and easy.” Hume is grateful for the opportune assistance:
“Thank ye, friend; should you ever have occasion to
come to the North, I’ll endeavour to do as much for you.”</p>

<p>Parliament was not summoned until November 15,
1837; in the interval, Doyle produced two or three ingenious
cartoons summarizing the situation. One of the best of these
represents the field of contest like the preceding versions;
it is entitled, “Retzsch’s Extraordinary Design of Satan
playing at Chess with Man for his Soul, copied by HB in
his freest manner” (September 29, 1837). The Great Dan
takes the place of the evil one, the skull and cross-bones are
mounted as his ensign, and he is evidently master of the
board. “Man” is personated by Lord Melbourne, who is
evidently in perplexity as to his next move. Britannia is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
personifying man’s good angel, and she is pitifully regarding
the loser.</p>

<p>“A Game at Chess (again): the Queen in Danger” is
another version of the situation in the recess. This
appeared October 20, 1837, with the quotation, “A
change came o’er the spirit of my dream.” The youthful
sovereign is matched against Lord Palmerston. The
Queen’s political tutor and adviser, Lord Melbourne, is
standing behind the chair of his royal mistress. Lord
Palmerston has put the Queen in jeopardy; Her Majesty
is evidently anxious, but fails to master the right move.
Melbourne sees the situation, and looks on with some excitement,
but is enjoined by Palmerston to refrain from
prompting his royal pupil’s play.</p>

<p>This situation is further exemplified in two later
cartoons: “Susannah and the Elders” (October 27, 1837),
in which the Queen is riding between Lords Melbourne and
Palmerston; the spot appears to be Brighton, near the
Pavilion, then a royal residence. The other version is
borrowed from the popular farce, “High Life below Stairs
(inverted), as lately performed at Windsor by Her Majesty’s
servants” (October 31, 1837). The Queen is seen, seated on
a sofa, but partly screened from view by a curtain. Lord
Melbourne, who makes a handsome “my lord duke,” is
monopolizing the youthful beauty; he observes to Lord
Palmerston, who is also in livery, with a cockade&mdash;“Stand
off; you are a Commoner. Nothing under nobility approaches
Kitty.” Lord Palmerston is not overawed by
these exclusive pretensions; as a representative of the
Commons, he seizes his advantage,&mdash;“And what becomes
of your dignity, if we refuse the supplies?”</p>

<p>A pungent epitome of the incidents of electioneering is
thus set forth by an anonymous poetaster:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Rights of Women; or, a View of the Hustings with
Female Suffrage, 1853.” George Cruikshank, whose hand
was turned to the illustration of nearly every event which
occurred in his long career, had produced election satires
like his contemporaries at the beginning of the century.
Later on, we find him turning his somewhat waning vigour
to utilize the agitation for “Female Enfranchisement,”
which, as a branch of “Women’s Rights,” appears to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
come before the public in 1852-3. A fanciful and farcical
prospect of the hustings when lady voters should rule the
day presents the rival aspirants pictured as “The Ladies’
Candidate” and “The Gentlemen’s Candidate.” The
latter is quite left to desolation. “Screw-driver, the Great
Political Economist,” beyond his boardmen, stands alone.
Although a placard is mounted advising the electoral community
not to vote for “Ignorant puppies,” the “Champion
of the Fair” seems to have a lively time of it; Cupid, or
his representative, upholds the appeal, “Vote for Darling
and Parliamentary Balls Once a Week;” the committee
and supporters of Sir Charles are ladies, apparelled in the
height of the fashions for 1852. Behind the tigerish
candidate for parliamentary honours is a group of melancholy
troubadours, travestied much as Cruikshank and
Thackeray used to depict those worthy guitar-strummers
at the now-obsolete “Beulah Spa.” Great unanimity
prevails in the mob; not only are the newly enfranchised
fair ones giving their own votes, they go farther, and coerce
the sterner sex, for all the well-regulated males are brought
forward, under the influence of beauty, to record their votes
for the chosen of the ladies. On the extreme left is seen
one forlorn individual who has evidently lingering doubts
of Sir Charles’s programme, or an inclination to support
the political economist, “Ugly Old Stingy;” but his wife
is forcibly arguing him into an obedient frame of mind.
The voters all carry bouquets and wear extensive favours.
“Husband and Wife” voters are arrived first at the poll;
and, following a mounted champion “in armour clad”
with a heart for his device, comes the last section of
“Sweetheart Voters,” the “male things” docilely following
the mistresses of their affections. “The Friends of Sir
Charles Darling are Requested to Meet this Evening at the
Assembly Rooms&mdash;the Hon. Mrs. Manley in the Chair.
Tea and Coffee at 7 o’clock.” Even Cruikshank’s imagination
had not risen to the elevation of lady candidates for
senatorial as well as electoral honours, or he would doubtless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
have favoured the public with some original (pictorial)
views on this question.</p>

<p>The general election which took place in July, 1857,
found two famous men in the annals of literature contesting
for senatorial honours, when W. M. Thackeray and his
friend James Hannay were hopefully canvassing, on opposite
political platforms, two constituencies, the former for
Oxford, the latter for Dumfries, which his father, the Scotch
banker, had unsuccessfully fought in the Conservative
interest at the successive general elections of 1832 and
1835.</p>

<p>James Hannay again discovered, in 1857, that the
electors of Dumfries remained consistent to Whig principles.
The novelist and essayist was beaten at the hustings; but
he has left something more characteristic than the average
of parliamentary orations in the delightful essay upon
“Electioneering,” contributed to the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
with the writing of which the defeated candidate immediately
consoled himself for his recent disappointment.</p>

<p>The canvassing rejoiced Hannay’s enthusiastic temperament.
The varieties of the genus voter are so infinite that
his eye for character was constantly studying original
types; he discovered that the work is hard, and that the
qualities a good canvasser must combine are as various as
the dispositions he has to encounter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“He must have unwearied activity, imperturbable good temper,
popular manners, and a wonderful memory. Every person who has
made a trial of electioneering can testify to the exhaustion and fatigue
of the first canvass, the swarm of new faces seen and flitting through
the mind in strange confusion, the impossibility of distinguishing
between the voter who had a leaning to you, but doubted your fidelity
to the Maynooth Grant, and his next-door neighbour who was coming
round to you against his former prejudice, because of your freedom
from religious bigotry. The mental eye wearies of the kaleidoscope
that has been turning before it for hours. The hand aches with
incessant shaking. The head aches with incessant observation. You
fling yourself wearied at nightfall into an easy chair in your committee-room,
and plunge eagerly into sherry and soda-water. You could lie
down and sleep like a general after a battle. But your committee is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
about to meet, as a staring blue bill on the hotel wall informs the
public; and a score of people have news for you. Tomkins, the hatter,
is wavering&mdash;a man who can influence four or five; the enemy have
set going a story that you beat your wife, and you must have a placard
out showing that you are a bachelor. A gang are drinking champagne
at the Blue Boar (one of the enemy’s houses), fellows whose potations
are usually of the poorest kind; your opinion is wanted on a new
squib; the manager of the theatre is below, waiting to see if you will
patronize his theatre with an early ‘bespeak night,’ and whether you
will have ‘Black-Eyed Susan,’ or ‘Douglas;’ a deputation of proprietors
of donkeys wants to hear your views on the taxation of
French asses’ milk. Who, under such circumstances, can retain in his
memory all the details of the canvass of the day?”</p></blockquote>

<p>However galling the temporary disappointment experienced
by Hannay and Thackeray respectively, their
readers had no reason to regret that, as the great novelist
wrote, philosophically accepting his defeat, “they were
sent back to take their places with their pens and ink at
their desks, and leave their successful opponents to a
business which they understood better.” The test of tact
and temper was certainly applied to the two novelists when
competing for seats in the Commons.</p>

<p>Thackeray aspired to take the place in Parliament for
the city of Oxford which his friend Neate, at the time
Professor of Political Economy in that university, had lost
for an alleged contravention of the Corrupt Practices Act,
thus described by Thackeray at the hustings: “He was
found guilty of twopennyworth of bribery which he never
committed.” This was Thackeray’s ostensible motive for
his candidature: “A Parliament which has swallowed so
many camels, strained at that little gnat, and my friend,
your representative, the very best man you could find to
represent you, was turned back, and you were left without
a man. I cannot hope, I never thought, to equal him; I
only came forward at a moment when I felt it necessary
that some one professing his principles, and possessing
your confidence, should be ready to step into the gap
which he had made.”</p>

<p>The author of the electioneering squib directed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
“Young Liberal Glory” as against “Old Tory Glory” in
1837, was, twenty years later, found consistently advocating
the Liberal principles which had inspired his early writings
in the <i>Constitutional</i>. Thackeray appeared as an advocate
of the ballot, was “for having people amused after they had
done their worship on a Sunday;” while, “as for triennial
Parliaments, if the constituents desire them, I am for
them.”</p>

<p>The following passages from his address enlightened the
electors of Oxford upon Thackeray’s political convictions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I would use my best endeavours not merely to enlarge the
constituencies, but to popularize the Government of this country.
With no feeling but that of goodwill towards those leading aristocratic
families who are administering the chief offices of the State, I believe
it could be benefited by the skill and talent of persons less aristocratic,
and that the country thinks so likewise.... The usefulness of a
member of Parliament is best tested at home; and should you think
fit to elect me as your representative, I promise to use my utmost
endeavour to increase and advance the social happiness, the knowledge,
and the power of the people.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One point in his speech at the hustings, a characteristic
allusion to the paramount influence of the Marlborough
dukes, for many generations masters of the Oxford elections,
was in the true Titmarshian vein, and worthy of the
occasion:&mdash;“I hear that not long since&mdash;in the memory
of many now alive&mdash;this independent city was patronized
by a great university, and that a great duke, who lived not
very far from here, at the time of the election used to put
on his boots, and ride down and order the freemen of
Oxford to elect a member for him.” By a curious coincidence,
not altogether reassuring, Thackeray’s reputation at
Oxford had somehow failed to reach the majority with
whom he was thrown into contact, as one of his committee-men
has assured the writer. They mainly asserted that
“he could not speak,” to which the candidate retorted
“he knew that, but he could write.” Unaccountable as it
appears, the fame of his writings had not, in those days,
penetrated to any extent this short distance, as the novelist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
learned by direct and disenchanting experience. He said,
in his valedictory remarks, “Perhaps I thought my name
was better known than it is.” This illusion, natural in
itself, ought to have been dispelled by a former revelation
of unsuspected ignorance, which, though unflattering to
the author, had, as related by the sufferer, its ludicrous
side. Thackeray had betaken himself to Oxford on a
previous occasion, with the intention of addressing his
lectures on “The English Humorists” to the rising youth
at Alma Mater, and, as it was necessary to obtain the
licence of the university authorities, he waited upon the
chancellor’s resident deputy, who received him blandly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Pray, what can I do to serve you, sir?” inquired the functionary.
“My name is Thackeray.” “So I see by this card.” “I seek permission
to lecture within the precincts.” “Ah! you are a lecturer.
What subjects do you undertake&mdash;religious or political?” “Neither;
I am a literary man.” “Have you written anything?” “Yes; I am
the author of ‘Vanity Fair.’” “I presume a Dissenter. Has that
anything to do with John Bunyan’s book?” “Not exactly. I have
also written ‘Pendennis.’” “Never heard of those works; but no
doubt they are proper books.” “I have also contributed to <i>Punch</i>.”
“<i>Punch!</i> I have heard of that. Is it not a ribald publication?”</p></blockquote>

<p>On his reception in Oxford in the character of a canvasser,
Thackeray addressed the electors with sturdy
independence, beyond electioneering persuasive beguilements:&mdash;“You
know whether I have acted honestly
towards you; and you on the other side will say whether
I ever solicited a vote when I knew that vote was promised
to my opponent; or whether I have not always said, ‘Sir,
keep your word. Here is my hand on it. Let us part
good friends.’” Although beaten by the Right Hon.
Edward Cardwell, Thackeray retained his good humour,
energetically enjoining the extension of courtesy to his
successful opponent and to the opposition party. A cry of
“Bribery” being raised against them, he continued:
“Don’t cry out bribery. If you know of it, prove it; but,
as I am innocent of bribery myself, I do not choose to
fancy that other men are not equally loyal and honest.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
He attributed his defeat to the advanced views he avowed&mdash;and
which, as he asserted, “he would not blink to be
made a duke or a marquis to-morrow”&mdash;on the question
of “allowing a man to have harmless pleasures when he
had done his worship on Sundays. I expected to have a
hiss, but they have taken a more dangerous shape&mdash;the
shape of slander. Those gentlemen who will take the
trouble to read my books&mdash;and I should be glad to have
as many of you for subscribers as will come forward&mdash;will
be able to say whether there is anything in them that
should not be read by any one’s children, or my own, or by
any Christian man.”</p>

<p>The most characteristic anecdote which has survived of
this interesting incident in Thackeray’s experience as an
“electioneerer,” exhibits him in a thoroughly John Bull
attitude. While looking out of the hotel window, amused
at the humours of the scene, in which he was only the
second performer, a passing crowd, from hooting, proceeded
to rough-handling, and the supporters of Mr. Cardwell,
being in the minority against their assailants, would have
been badly maltreated, but for Thackeray’s starting up in
the greatest possible excitement, and, rushing downstairs,
notwithstanding the efforts to detain him of more hardened
electioneers, who evidently were of opinion that a trifling
correction of the opposite party might be beneficial <i>pour
encourager les autres</i>; he was not to be deterred, but,
expressing in strong language his opinion of such unmanly
behaviour, he hurled himself into the thick of the
fray; and, awful spectacle for his party! his tall form&mdash;Thackeray,
be it remembered, stood upwards of 6ft. 2in.&mdash;was
next seen towering above the crowd, dealing about him
right and left with frantic energy in defence of his opponent’s
partisans and in defiance of his own friends.

1642. “The Inhabitants of the Citie of Bathe express their great
greifes in that they have little company this summer, the poor guides are
now necessitated to guide one another from the alehouse, lest they should
lose their practice. Pluto’s cauldron (the hot bath) had never less purboyled
fleshe in it to please the palate of his Courtiers. The poor Fiddlers
are ready to hang themselves in their strings for a pastime, for want of
other employments.” (<i>Certaine Intelligences from Bath</i>, 1642. Pamphlets.

Andrew Marvell, who was made assistant-secretary to Milton, when he
served the Protector, was, by Cromwell’s death, thrown out of employment.
The burgesses of Hull, with whom he was deservedly popular, elected Marvell
their representative to Parliament. The payment, of which so much has been
made, for these services did not amount to a munificent retainer, the salary
being fixed at two shillings a day for borough members; kindly remembrances
in the form of acceptable gifts were, however, sent by constituents
to those representatives who won their good wishes. Thus Marvell writes to
the friends who sent him to parliament: “We must first give you thanks
for the kind present you have pleased to send us, which will give occasion
to us to remember you often; but the quantity is so great, that it might
make sober men forgetful.”</p></div>

In reply to the London and Wiltshire petitions against the vexatious
prorogations&mdash;which Charles justified on the excuse “that the unsettled
state of the nation made a longer interval necessary”&mdash;the king volunteered
an audacious statement which was likely to astonish constitutional minds.
He said that “he was the head of the Government, and the only judge of
what was fit to be done in such cases, and that he would do that which he
thought most for the good of himself and his people, desiring that they
would not meddle with a matter that was so essential a part of his prerogative.”
This brazen-faced assumption is so coloured by Carolian waggery,
that we must fancy the Merry Monarch, if he saw the wit of his speech,
making the reply in question with his “tongue in his cheek.”</p></div>

The term “Tacker” was due to the chief member for Oxford University,
William Bromley, having, in the session just closed, moved “That
the Bill to prevent occasional nonconformity might be <i>tacked</i> to the Land
Tax Bill.” The practice of tacking was condemned by the Lords, most of
whom had signed a resolution to the effect they would never admit a “tack”
to a money-bill. The party in the Commons strove vigorously to carry their
point upon two bills being thus conjoined, whence they began to be known
as “the Tackers.” In return, they stigmatized their opponents as “Sneakers.”</p></div>

Lord Grimston’s curious comedy, in five acts and in verse(!), “The
Lawyer’s Fortune, or Love in a Hollow Tree,” was first published in 1704,
as a quarto; being a foolish attempt, in fact, the merest trash, the author,
it is said, suppressed it. The edition printed, as alleged, by the Duchess
of Marlborough’s orders, is dated 1736. Besides the heading of an elephant
performing on a rope, a satirical frontispiece was engraved, in which Lord
Grimston is seen interrogating a sage, ensconced in the “hollow tree” of his
play; a jackass is the most conspicuous object in the foreground; the
animal wears a coronet, and is intended to typify the doltish author, who
is farther ridiculed in a burlesque dedication “To the Right Sensible the
Lord Flame.”</p></div>

“The Humours of an Election” seems to have inspired not only
artists and balladists, but playwrights and opera composers also. “The
Humours of the Town, a Dramatic Interlude,” referring to the contested
election of 1774, is of this order. M.P. Andrews wrote “a new musical
Interlude” under this title, 1774. “The Election,” a comedy in three
acts, appeared in 1749; and “a new opera, called the Election,” was
published in 1817. “The Country Election,” a farce in two acts, is due
to D. J. Trusler, 1786; and “The Humours of an Election,” by
F. Pilon, was published in 1780. Besides these and other plays, several
poems were printed under this title, to some of which we have occasion to
refer.</p></div>

As concerned Churchill and the artist, they both departed, it may be
said, “warring to the very verge of the grave,” in 1764. Less than a
month before the painter’s death appeared Churchill’s familiar lines, treating
his antagonist as already slain by his satire:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hogarth would draw him (Envy must allow)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E’en to the life, was <span class="smcap">Hogarth living now</span>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Curiously enough, five weeks after these lines appeared, the poet was likewise
gathered to those shades to which he had with sportive venom prematurely
consigned his antagonist, in all probability without anticipating the
literal fulfilment of his prophecy.</p></div>

A less dignified view is taken of the lord mayor’s officious intervention,
in the <i>Political Register</i>, 1768, where it states he had degraded,
by his personal interference, “the dignity of his office to that of a petty
constable;” and in a letter referring to the royal and ministerial favours
conferred in return “for his active and spirited behaviour,” the new state
official is, in his capacity of merchant-tailor, thus addressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“And now, my lord, as we are <i>brother tailors</i>, how could you be so unkind

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
